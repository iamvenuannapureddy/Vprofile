### Lecture: Containerizing a Microservice Application

#### Overview:
In this lecture, we will discuss how to containerize a microservice application. Microservice architecture is a popular method in modern software development, enabling faster delivery of features. As a DevOps engineer, understanding how to containerize microservices is essential.

#### Steps to Containerize a Microservice Application:

1. **Understanding Microservices**:
   - Microservices architecture involves breaking down applications into smaller, independent services.
   - Advantages include faster development cycles, scalability, and efficient updates.
   - In this lecture, we focus on how to containerize such microservices.

2. **Microservices Overview**:
   - **Components**: 
     - **Nginx** (API Gateway) - Handles communication and routing.
     - **Client** (Angular Application) - Frontend service.
     - **Node API** - Backend API service.
     - **Java API** - Another backend service (Books API) using MySQL.
     - **MongoDB** - NoSQL database for Node API.
     - **MySQL** - SQL database for Java API.

3. **Source Code Repository**:
   - The microservices' source code is hosted in a **Mono Repo** on GitHub:
     - Repository: `E-mart app`.
     - It contains services such as Angular, Node, Java API, and Nginx.

4. **Clone Source Code**:
   - Use Git to clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone <SSH URL>
     ```
   - Open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code:
     ```bash
     code .
     ```

5. **Creating Dockerfiles**:
   - **Client Dockerfile**:
     - Multi-stage Dockerfile to build and serve the Angular application using Nginx.
     - Example:
       ```Dockerfile
       FROM node:14 AS web-build
       WORKDIR /usr/src/app/client
       COPY . .
       RUN npm install && npm run build --prod
       FROM nginx
       COPY --from=web-build /usr/src/app/client/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
       COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
       ```
     - Nginx configuration: Ensure that the correct HTML files are served at the right routes.

   - **Node API Dockerfile**:
     - Multi-stage Dockerfile to build and run the Node API.
     - Example:
       ```Dockerfile
       FROM node:14 AS node-build
       WORKDIR /usr/src/app
       COPY . .
       RUN npm install
       FROM node:14
       WORKDIR /usr/src/app
       COPY --from=node-build /usr/src/app /usr/src/app
       EXPOSE 5000
       CMD ["npm", "start"]
       ```

   - **Java API Dockerfile**:
     - Multi-stage Dockerfile to build and run the Java API.
     - Example:
       ```Dockerfile
       FROM maven:3.8.5-openjdk-8 AS maven-build
       WORKDIR /usr/src/app
       COPY . .
       RUN mvn install
       FROM openjdk:8
       WORKDIR /usr/src/app
       COPY --from=maven-build /usr/src/app/target/book-api.jar /usr/src/app/book-api.jar
       EXPOSE 9000
       CMD ["java", "-jar", "book-api.jar"]
       ```

6. **Enginex API Gateway**:
   - Using the official Nginx image with a custom configuration:
     ```Dockerfile
     FROM nginx:alpine
     COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
     CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
     ```

7. **Docker Compose**:
   - The Docker Compose file manages multiple containers for the entire microservices stack.
   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'
   services:
     client:
       build: ./client
       ports:
         - "4200:4200"
     api:
       build: ./node-api
       ports:
         - "5000:5000"
       depends_on:
         - nginx
     web-api:
       build: ./java-api
       ports:
         - "9000:9000"
       depends_on:
         - db
     nginx:
       image: nginx:alpine
       ports:
         - "8080:80"
       volumes:
         - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
       depends_on:
         - client
         - api
         - web-api
     db:
       image: mongo
       environment:
         - MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE=epoch
     mysql:
       image: mysql:5.7
       environment:
         MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: imdb_pass
         MYSQL_DATABASE: books
   ```

8. **Containerizing Microservices**:
   - Writing Dockerfiles for each microservice.
   - Using Docker Compose to run all microservices and dependencies together.

9. **Running and Troubleshooting**:
   - Run `docker-compose up -d` to start all services.
   - Use logs to debug issues and troubleshoot container errors (e.g., database connections, wrong configurations).

10. **Best Practices**:
    - Work closely with developers to understand build steps and hosting methods.
    - Ensure proper routing configurations in Nginx and other microservices.
    - Utilize GitOps for managing microservices through separate CI/CD pipelines.

This concludes the process of containerizing a microservice application, where Docker and Docker Compose play a crucial role in managing the infrastructure.
