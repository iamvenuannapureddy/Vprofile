# **Hands-On Kubernetes Cluster with Minikube**

This document outlines the step-by-step process to set up, test, and tear down a Kubernetes cluster locally using **Minikube**. This serves as a foundational exercise for running a Kubernetes cluster.

---

### **Prerequisites**
1. Install **Chocolatey** (Windows package manager).  
   - Open PowerShell with administrator privileges and run:  
     ```powershell
     Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
     ```
   - If you encounter a "restricted" error, temporarily disable antivirus and retry the command.

2. Restart PowerShell as an administrator after installing Chocolatey.

---

### **Step-by-Step Setup**

#### **1. Install Minikube and Kubernetes CLI**
- Run the following commands to install Minikube and Kubernetes CLI:
  ```powershell
  choco install minikube
  choco install kubernetes-cli
  ```
- Verify the installation:
  ```bash
  minikube --help
  kubectl --help
  ```
- If the commands are not recognized, restart your terminal and try again.

---

#### **2. Start Minikube**
- Start the Minikube cluster:
  ```bash
  minikube start
  ```
  - Minikube will download the necessary image and create a virtual machine (VM) on Oracle VirtualBox or another supported hypervisor.
  - This process may take a few minutes.

- Verify that the cluster is running:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```
  - Output: A single node (master node) should appear as ready.

---

#### **3. Minikube Configuration File**
- The Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`) uses the `~/.kube/config` file to interact with the cluster.
- Key sections of the `config` file:
  - **Clusters**: Contains server details for the Minikube cluster.
  - **Users**: Includes authentication credentials.
  - **Contexts**: Maps the user to the cluster.

---

#### **4. Deploy a Sample Application**
- Create a deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment hello-minikube --image=k8s.gcr.io/echoserver:1.4
  ```
- Verify the pod is running:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```
- View deployment details:
  ```bash
  kubectl get deployments
  ```

---

#### **5. Expose the Deployment**
- Expose the deployment as a service:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deployment hello-minikube --type=NodePort --port=8080
  ```
- Retrieve the service URL:
  ```bash
  minikube service hello-minikube --url
  ```
- Access the application in your browser using the URL.

---

#### **6. Clean Up**
- Delete the service:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete service hello-minikube
  ```
- Delete the deployment (removes associated pods):
  ```bash
  kubectl delete deployment hello-minikube
  ```

---

#### **7. Stop and Delete the Minikube Cluster**
- Stop the Minikube cluster:
  ```bash
  minikube stop
  ```
- Delete the Minikube cluster and associated resources:
  ```bash
  minikube delete
  ```

---

### **Outcome**
After completing these steps, you will have:
1. Installed and configured Minikube and Kubernetes CLI on your local machine.
2. Started a local Kubernetes cluster.
3. Deployed a sample application, exposed it as a service, and accessed it in a browser.
4. Learned to clean up resources and shut down the cluster.

---

### **Next Steps**
- Host a Java application on the Kubernetes cluster (to be covered in the next project).
- Experiment with different deployment tools such as **Kubeadm**, **COPS**, and **Amazon EKS** for more advanced setups.
