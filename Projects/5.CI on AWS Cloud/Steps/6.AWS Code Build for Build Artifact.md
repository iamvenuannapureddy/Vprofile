### AWS CodeBuild: Building Artifacts with S3 Integration

In this session, we set up an AWS CodeBuild job for building artifacts and storing them in an S3 bucket. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation for creating the CodeBuild project and configuring the necessary components.

#### **Setup:**

1. **CodeBuild Job for Building Artifacts:**
   - **Job Name**: vPro file build artifact
   - **Source**: Bitbucket repository (`CI-AWS` branch)
   - **Environment**: Ubuntu 7.0 image
   - **Service Role**: `CodeBuild 51 Profile Build Artifact Service Role`

2. **Buildspec File Configuration:**
   - **File Path**: `AWS-files/build_buildspec.yml`
   - **Commands**:
     - `apt update && install jq`
     - `mvn clean install -DskipTests`
     - `copy artifact to S3 bucket`

3. **Service Role Permissions**:
   - Attach policy for Code Artifact read-only access.

4. **Artifact Storage**:
   - The artifact is stored in an S3 bucket. This step is integrated into a future pipeline that connects multiple build jobs to upload artifacts directly to S3.

5. **Logs**:
   - Log group: `vPro file build artifacts`
   - Stream Name: `build artifacts`

#### **Detailed Breakdown:**

- **CodeBuild Job**:  
  The build job fetches source code from Bitbucket, performs dependency management (downloading dependencies from Code Artifact), and builds artifacts using Maven (`mvn clean install -DskipTests`).

- **Buildspec File**:  
  Specifies the build commands, such as setting the Maven path, exporting the Code Artifact token, and generating the build artifact.

- **Artifact Storage**:  
  Artifacts generated from the build are pushed to the designated S3 bucket. This integration will be handled by a future pipeline.

- **Service Role Configuration**:  
  The service role associated with this build job has permissions to access the Code Artifact repository for downloading dependencies.

- **Logs**:  
  Build logs are monitored in real-time through CloudWatch. Make sure the log group and stream name are consistent to avoid errors.

#### **Next Steps**:  
In the next lecture, we will tie these build jobs together into a pipeline to automate the entire workflow from code analysis to artifact deployment in S3.

This covers all necessary steps for creating a CodeBuild job to build artifacts with S3 integration.
