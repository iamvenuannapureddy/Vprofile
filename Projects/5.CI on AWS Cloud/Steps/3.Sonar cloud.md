### Creating a Sonar Cloud Project in Jenkins Continuous Integration

In this lecture, you will learn how to create a project on **Sonar Cloud** for a Jenkins Continuous Integration (CI) project. 

#### Steps to Set Up Sonar Cloud:

1. **Log in to GitHub**:
   - Ensure you are logged into your GitHub account. 
   - Navigate to [sonarcloud.io](https://sonarcloud.io/) or simply search for Sonar Cloud and log in using GitHub credentials.

2. **Generate Sonar Cloud Token**:
   - After logging into Sonar Cloud, click on the dropdown in the top-right corner and select **My Account**.
   - Navigate to **Security** and create a new token by giving it a unique name, such as `Wipro-Sonar-Cloud`.
   - Generate and save the token securely. This token will be used as an authentication mechanism for CodeBuild to access Sonar Cloud.

3. **Create a New Organization**:
   - Click the plus symbol (+) and select **Create New Organization**.
   - Choose to create a new organization manually and provide a unique name.
   - Select the free plan and click **Create Organization**.

4. **Analyze New Project**:
   - Once the organization is created, click on **Sonar Cloud** and then **Analyze New Project**.
   - Alternatively, you can click the plus symbol and choose **Analyze New Project** from there.
   - Select **Create a project manually**.
   - Ensure your organization is selected from the dropdown and provide a display name for the project, such as `Profile Repo`. 
   - Set the **Project Key** to something unique, ensuring it’s available (e.g., `profile-repo`).

5. **Define Project Visibility**:
   - Choose **Public** visibility (for free use) or **Private** (requires a paid plan). 
   - Click **Next** and proceed to create the project.

6. **Save Project Information**:
   - After creating the project, go to the **Information** section and copy the **Project Key** and **Organization** name.
   - Save these details along with the Sonar Cloud URL (`https://sonarcloud.io`) for future use in your Jenkins project setup.

By following these steps, you've successfully set up your Sonar Cloud project, which will be utilized in a Jenkins CI pipeline to analyze and manage code quality.
