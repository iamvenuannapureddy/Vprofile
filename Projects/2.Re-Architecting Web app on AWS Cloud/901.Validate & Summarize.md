Certainly! Below is a clear and professional step-by-step outline for validating and cleaning up the AWS CloudFront setup:

### **Validation and Cleanup of AWS CloudFront**

---

#### **Step 1: Validation**

1. **Access CloudFront**:
   - Open a different browser (e.g., Firefox) or ensure the current browser cache is cleared.
   
2. **Inspect with Developer Tools**:
   - Press **F12** on the keyboard to open Developer Tools.
   - Click on the **Console** tab.
   - Enter your CloudFront URL (e.g., `https://vprofile.info.xyz`).
   - Hit **Enter** and wait for the website to load.

3. **Check via Headers**:
   - In the Developer Tools, go to the **Headers** section.
   - Look for `via` to confirm CloudFront as the source:
     - Example: `https://d12345abcdef.cloudfront.net`.

4. **Understanding Content Delivery**:
   - Confirm that the content is routed through CloudFront to the Load Balancer, and in turn to the instances.
   - Cached content is delivered from CloudFront, reducing latency and improving performance.

#### **Step 2: Cleanup**

1. **Disable and Delete CloudFront Distribution**:
   - Go to AWS Management Console -> **CloudFront**.
   - Select the CloudFront distribution.
   - Click **Disable** the distribution.
   - Wait for the distribution to be fully disabled (state: `Deployed` should change to `Disabled`).
   - Once disabled, select the distribution and click **Delete**.

2. **Delete DNS Record**:
   - Navigate to your domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy).
   - Delete the CNAME record pointing to the CloudFront distribution.

3. **Delete RDS**:
   - Go to AWS Management Console -> **RDS**.
   - Select the database.
   - Click **Delete** and create a final snapshot if required. Ensure backups are disabled.

4. **Delete ElastiCache**:
   - Navigate to AWS Management Console -> **ElastiCache**.
   - Select your Memcached or Redis cache.
   - Click **Delete** and ensure you remove all associated resources.

5. **Delete Amazon MQ**:
   - Go to AWS Management Console -> **Amazon MQ**.
   - Select the broker and click **Delete**.

6. **Delete Beanstalk Environment**:
   - Go to AWS Management Console -> **Elastic Beanstalk**.
   - Select the environment.
   - Click **Terminate** and confirm deletion. 
   - Ensure that backend security groups are manually edited (i.e., remove rules that allow connections from Beanstalk) before terminating the environment.

7. **Remove Backend Security Group**:
   - Navigate to AWS Management Console -> **EC2** -> **Security Groups**.
   - Select the backend security group (`vprofile-backend`).
   - Click **Delete** after removing all inbound rules.

#### **Final Steps**:

- Ensure all services have been successfully deleted.
- Verify the complete removal by checking the AWS Management Console or domain registrar.
- Once all services are deleted, confirm the cleanup is complete.

This process ensures that all AWS CloudFront and associated resources are properly validated and cleaned up.
