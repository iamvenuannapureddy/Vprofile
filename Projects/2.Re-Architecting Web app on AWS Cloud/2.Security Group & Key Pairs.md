**AWS Application Stack Setup: Security Groups and Key Pair Creation**

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### **1. Elastic Beanstalk Security Groups Overview**
- Elastic Beanstalk creates:
  - A security group for the EC2 instance hosting the application.
  - A security group for the load balancer.
- Elastic Beanstalk automatically configures rules to allow traffic from the load balancer security group to the application security group.

#### **2. Backend Services Security Group Setup**
- **Backend Services:** Amazon MQ, RDS, and ElastiCache.
- **Security Group Name:** `vprofile-rearch-backend-sg` (to indicate it is for the re-architecture project).
- **Steps to Create Backend Security Group:**
  1. Navigate to **AWS Management Console** → **EC2 Service**.
  2. Select **Security Groups** and click **Create Security Group**.
  3. Provide the following details:
     - **Name:** `vprofile-rearch-backend-sg`
     - **Description:** Security group for backend services in the re-architecture project.
     - **Inbound Rules:** Leave blank initially.
     - **Outbound Rules:** Default (allow all outbound traffic).
  4. Click **Create Security Group**.

- **Add Rules to Backend Security Group:**
  1. After creating the security group, select it and click **Edit Inbound Rules**.
  2. Add the following rule:
     - **Type:** All Traffic
     - **Protocol:** All
     - **Port Range:** All
     - **Source:** The security group’s own **Security Group ID** (to allow internal communication).
  3. Add a description (e.g., "Allow internal traffic within backend services").
  4. Click **Save Rules**.

#### **3. Update Rules for Beanstalk Security Group (Later Step)**
- After Elastic Beanstalk is created, update the backend security group to allow traffic from the Beanstalk security group:
  1. Navigate to the backend security group.
  2. Edit the inbound rules and add a new rule:
     - **Type:** Custom (appropriate for the backend services).
     - **Source:** Elastic Beanstalk security group ID.
  3. Save the changes.

#### **4. Create a Key Pair for Elastic Beanstalk EC2 Instance**
- **Purpose:** To log in to the Beanstalk EC2 instance for troubleshooting if required.
- **Steps to Create Key Pair:**
  1. Navigate to **AWS Management Console** → **EC2 Service**.
  2. Select **Key Pairs** and click **Create Key Pair**.
  3. Provide the following details:
     - **Name:** `vprofile-rearch-key` (indicates re-architecture project key).
     - **File Format:** `.pem` (for SSH access).
  4. Click **Create Key Pair**.
  5. Download and securely store the key pair file.

### Summary
- Created a security group for backend services (`vprofile-rearch-backend-sg`) and configured rules for internal communication.
- Created a key pair (`vprofile-rearch-key.pem`) for Elastic Beanstalk EC2 instance login.

#### **Next Steps**
In the next phase, we will proceed to create an Amazon RDS instance for the database backend.
