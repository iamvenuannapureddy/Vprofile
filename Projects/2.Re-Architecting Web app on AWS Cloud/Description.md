### **End-to-End Process for Web Application Deployment on AWS**

---

#### **Step 1: Login to AWS Account**
- Log in to the **AWS Management Console** using your credentials.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create and manage resources.

---

#### **Step 2: Create Key Pair for Beanstalk Instance Login**
- Navigate to the **EC2 Dashboard** → **Key Pairs**.
- Create a new key pair and download the `.pem` file.  
  - Example: `beanstalk-keypair.pem`
- Save it securely for accessing Beanstalk instances.

---

#### **Step 3: Create Security Groups**
- **Elasticache, RDS & ActiveMQ Security Group**:
  - Go to **EC2 Dashboard** → **Security Groups**.
  - Create a security group and configure the following rules:
    - Allow traffic from the Beanstalk security group for required ports (e.g., 3306 for RDS, 11211 for ElastiCache, 5671 for ActiveMQ).
    - Allow internal traffic within the same VPC.

---

#### **Step 4: Create Backend Resources**
1. **RDS (Relational Database Service)**:
   - Go to **RDS Dashboard** → **Create Database**.
   - Choose the database engine (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
   - Assign the previously created security group to allow communication with Beanstalk.
2. **Amazon ElastiCache**:
   - Go to **ElastiCache Dashboard** → **Create Cluster**.
   - Select the type (e.g., Redis, Memcached) and associate the same security group.
3. **Amazon ActiveMQ**:
   - Go to **Amazon MQ Dashboard** → **Create Broker**.
   - Configure settings and assign the security group.

---

#### **Step 5: Create Elastic Beanstalk Environment**
- Go to **Elastic Beanstalk Dashboard** → **Create Environment**.
- Choose **Web Server Environment** and configure the application settings.
- Deploy a sample application to test the environment.

---

#### **Step 6: Update Security Group of Backend to Allow Traffic from Beanstalk Security Group**
- Edit the backend security group (used for RDS, ElastiCache, and ActiveMQ).
- Add inbound rules to allow traffic from the Beanstalk security group.

---

#### **Step 7: Update Security Group of Backend to Allow Internal Traffic**
- Add rules to the backend security group to allow internal traffic within the same VPC.  
  - This ensures seamless communication between resources.

---

#### **Step 8: Launch EC2 Instance for Database Initialization**
- Go to **EC2 Dashboard** → **Launch Instance**.
- Select an AMI, instance type, and associate the previously created key pair.
- Assign a security group that allows access to the database.

---

#### **Step 9: Login to the Instance and Initialize RDS Database**
- SSH into the instance using the key pair:
```bash
ssh -i beanstalk-keypair.pem ec2-user@<EC2_Public_IP>
```
- Connect to the RDS database and initialize it:
```bash
mysql -h <RDS_Endpoint> -u <DB_User> -p
CREATE DATABASE myapp;
```

---

#### **Step 10: Change Health Check on Beanstalk**
- Go to **Elastic Beanstalk Dashboard** → **Health Check Settings**.
- Update the health check to point to a valid login endpoint (e.g., `/login`).

---

#### **Step 11: Add HTTPS Listener to Elastic Load Balancer**
- Navigate to **EC2 Dashboard** → **Load Balancers**.
- Add an HTTPS listener to the Beanstalk environment’s load balancer.
- Use an SSL certificate from **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**.

---

#### **Step 12: Build Artifact with Backend Information**
- Build the application artifact (e.g., `.war` or `.jar`) with updated backend configurations such as database credentials and endpoints:
```bash
mvn clean package
```

---

#### **Step 13: Deploy Artifact to Beanstalk**
- Go to the **Elastic Beanstalk Dashboard** → **Upload and Deploy**.
- Upload the application artifact to deploy it to the environment.

---

#### **Step 14: Create CDN with SSL Certificate**
- Go to **CloudFront Dashboard** → **Create Distribution**.
- Use the Beanstalk environment URL as the origin.
- Add an SSL certificate to secure the distribution.

---

#### **Step 15: Update Entry in GoDaddy DNS Zones**
- Log in to your **GoDaddy** account and navigate to DNS settings.
- Add a **CNAME record** pointing your domain to the CloudFront distribution endpoint.

---

#### **Step 16: Test the URL**
- Open the application URL in a browser (e.g., `https://www.myappdomain.com`).
- Verify that:
  - The application loads successfully.
  - Backend integrations (RDS, ElastiCache, ActiveMQ) work correctly.
  - HTTPS is active and the SSL certificate is functional.

---

This process completes the **end-to-end deployment** of a web application using AWS Cloud.
