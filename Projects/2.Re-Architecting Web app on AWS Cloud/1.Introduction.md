# Refactoring with AWS

## Project Overview

This project focuses on refactoring and re-architecting the vProfile application stack using AWS services. In the previous project, we deployed the application on both local machines and AWS Cloud using a lift-and-shift strategy. In this project, we adopt a re-architecture or refactoring strategy to enhance agility, scalability, and performance while reducing operational overhead. The approach relies on Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings from AWS.

### Objectives:
1. Flexible infrastructure.
2. Pay-as-you-go model.
3. Infrastructure as code (IaC).
4. Utilize PaaS and SaaS for ease of management.
5. Minimize operational overhead.

## AWS Services Overview

### Frontend:
1. **Elastic Beanstalk**:
   - Manages EC2 instances, load balancer, and auto-scaling.
   - S3 bucket for storing application artifacts.

### Backend:
1. **Amazon RDS**:
   - Database platform for MySQL or other supported databases.
   - Handles scaling, backups, and maintenance automatically.
2. **Amazon ElastiCache**:
   - In-memory caching service.
   - Replacement for Memcached.
3. **Amazon MQ**:
   - Message broker service (replacement for RabbitMQ).
4. **Amazon Route 53**:
   - DNS service to resolve URLs to endpoints.
5. **Amazon CloudFront**:
   - Content Delivery Network (CDN) for global audience.

## Comparison of Services

| Legacy Service                | AWS Replacement          |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Tomcat on EC2                 | Elastic Beanstalk        |
| Load Balancer (Manual Setup)  | Elastic Load Balancer    |
| NFS                           | S3 or EFS                |
| MySQL on VM/EC2               | Amazon RDS               |
| Memcached on VM/EC2           | Amazon ElastiCache       |
| RabbitMQ on VM/EC2            | Amazon MQ                |
| DNS                           | Amazon Route 53          |
| Content Delivery              | Amazon CloudFront        |

## Architecture Design

1. **Frontend Flow**:
   - User accesses the URL resolved by Route 53.
   - Route 53 forwards requests to CloudFront.
   - CloudFront caches content and forwards requests to the Application Load Balancer (ALB) within Elastic Beanstalk.
   - ALB routes requests to EC2 instances (auto-scaled by Beanstalk).
   - Artifacts are stored in an S3 bucket.

2. **Backend Flow**:
   - Backend services include Amazon MQ, ElastiCache, and RDS.
   - All services interact through secure connections enabled by properly configured security groups.

## Step-by-Step Execution

### 1. AWS Account Setup:
1. Log in to your AWS account.
2. Create a key pair for accessing Beanstalk EC2 instances (if needed).

### 2. Security Groups:
1. Create a security group for backend services (RDS, ElastiCache, Amazon MQ).
2. Configure backend security group to allow internal traffic.
3. Update backend security group to allow traffic from Beanstalk security group.

### 3. Backend Services:
1. **Amazon RDS**:
   - Create an RDS instance for the database.
   - Note the RDS endpoint.
2. **Amazon ElastiCache**:
   - Create an ElastiCache cluster (Redis/Memcached).
   - Note the ElastiCache endpoint.
3. **Amazon MQ**:
   - Create an Amazon MQ broker.
   - Note the MQ endpoint.

### 4. Elastic Beanstalk Environment:
1. Create an Elastic Beanstalk environment for the application.
2. Configure the environment:
   - Set health check URL to `/login`.
   - Add an HTTPS listener (port 443) to the load balancer.

### 5. Database Initialization:
1. Launch an EC2 instance.
2. Use MySQL client to log in to RDS:
   ```bash
   mysql -h <RDS_ENDPOINT> -u <USERNAME> -p
   ```
3. Initialize the database with required schema and data.

### 6. Build and Deploy Artifacts:
1. Update application properties with backend service endpoints:
   - RDS endpoint.
   - ElastiCache endpoint.
   - Amazon MQ endpoint.
2. Build the application artifact using Maven or your preferred tool.
3. Deploy the artifact to the Beanstalk environment.

### 7. Content Delivery Network:
1. Create a CloudFront distribution.
2. Use an SSL certificate for HTTPS.
3. Configure CloudFront to point to the Beanstalk ALB.

### 8. DNS Configuration:
1. Update DNS records in Route 53:
   - Map the custom domain to the CloudFront endpoint.
2. Alternatively, update DNS in GoDaddy or another registrar.

### 9. Final Testing:
1. Access the application using the public URL.
2. Verify frontend and backend functionality.
3. Test scalability by simulating load.

## Key Benefits of Refactoring
1. Reduced operational overhead.
2. Improved agility and performance.
3. Easy scalability with auto-scaling and managed services.
4. Cost efficiency through a pay-as-you-go model.
5. Enhanced global reach with CDN (CloudFront).
