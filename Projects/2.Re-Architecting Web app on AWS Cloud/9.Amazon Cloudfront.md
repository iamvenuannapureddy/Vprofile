Certainly! Below is a clear and professional step-by-step outline for creating an AWS CloudFront distribution:

---

### **AWS CloudFront Distribution Setup**

**Objective**: Set up AWS CloudFront to deliver content globally with low latency and high transfer speeds.

---

#### **Step 1: Access AWS Management Console**

1. **Sign in** to your AWS Management Console at [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com).
2. Navigate to **CloudFront** from the Services menu.

---

#### **Step 2: Create a CloudFront Distribution**

1. **Choose Distribution Type**:
   - Select **Web** (for websites) or **RTMP** (for streaming video).

2. **Origin Setup**:
   - In the **Origin Domain Name**, select the appropriate **Load Balancer** (created through Beanstalk or another service).
   - For protocols, choose **HTTP** or **HTTPS**. If you have an existing HTTPS connection, match viewer can be used to handle both.

3. **Enter Distribution Details**:
   - Enter a descriptive name for the CloudFront distribution.
   - Viewer Policy: Ensure both **HTTP** and **HTTPS** are allowed.
   - Allowed HTTP Methods: Ensure **GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE** are selected.
   - Cache Settings: Use **Legacy Cache Settings** and include headers, query strings, and cookies if necessary.

4. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** (Optional):
   - WAF can protect your application from common threats, but it is not free. Enable if required.
   - For now, you can choose **Do not enable security protections**.

5. **Edge Locations**:
   - Select **Use all edge locations** for global performance.
   - Alternatively, choose specific regions if required, but note the difference in cost.

6. **Alternate Domain Name**:
   - Enter your **own domain name** (e.g., `wiproraj.mydomain.xyz`).
   - Ensure the domain matches the certificate from **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**. 

7. **SSL Certificate**:
   - Select the SSL certificate that matches your domain name.
   - Without a matching certificate, HTTPS will show as insecure.

8. **Security Policy**:
   - Keep the default security policy unless specific configurations are required.

9. **Create Distribution**:
   - Click **Create Distribution** to deploy the CloudFront distribution.

---

#### **Step 3: Update Domain Records**

1. Navigate to your domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy) and edit the DNS records.
2. Add a new **CNAME** record:
   - **Name**: Use the alternate domain name created (`wiproraj.mydomain.xyz`).
   - **Value**: Use the CloudFront distribution domain (e.g., `d12345abcdef.cloudfront.net`).
   - Ensure **HTTPS** is enabled for secure connections.
3. Save the DNS changes.

---

#### **Step 4: Verify Deployment**

1. Check the status of the CloudFront distribution.
   - If status is still "Deploying," wait for about 10 minutes for the distribution to become available.
2. After deployment, test your domain to ensure it routes to the CloudFront distribution securely and efficiently.

By following these steps, you set up a CloudFront distribution to cache and serve your websiteâ€™s content globally with improved performance.
