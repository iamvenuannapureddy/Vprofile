### **Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up RabbitMQ Using Amazon MQ**

#### **1. Search for RabbitMQ (Amazon MQ)**
- Log in to the AWS Management Console.
- In the search bar, type **"Amazon MQ"** and select the **Amazon MQ** service.

---

#### **2. Overview of Amazon MQ**
- Amazon MQ is a **managed message broker** service that supports **Apache ActiveMQ** and **RabbitMQ**.
- Instead of manually setting up RabbitMQ on an EC2 instance, Amazon MQ offers a fully managed solution.
- The process involves creating a broker, obtaining the endpoint, and configuring your application to use it.

---

#### **3. Start Creating a RabbitMQ Broker**
1. **Get Started**
   - Click on **Get Started**.
   - Select **RabbitMQ** as the broker type.
   - Click **Next**.

2. **Broker Deployment Type**
   - Choose **Single-instance Broker**.
     - **Note**: This is cost-effective for this exercise. For production, consider using **Cluster Deployment** for high availability.

---

#### **4. Configure the Broker**
1. **Broker Details**
   - **Name**: `vprofile-rabbitmq`.
   - **Instance Type**: Select the smallest instance type (e.g., `mq.t3.micro`).
   - **Username**: `rabbit`.
   - **Password**: 
     - Create a strong password (minimum 12 characters).
     - Save the username and password securely for later use in the application configuration file (`application.properties`).

2. **Broker Engine**
   - **Version**: Use the default version (e.g., `3.13`).

3. **Additional Configuration**
   - **Broker Configuration**: Use default settings.
   - **CloudWatch Logs**: Disable (optional for this exercise). For production, enable logging for monitoring and troubleshooting.

---

#### **5. Configure Access and Security**
1. **Access Type**
   - Select **Private Access**.
     - This ensures the broker is accessible only within the VPC and not publicly over the internet.

2. **VPC and Subnets**
   - **VPC**: Use the **default VPC**.
   - **Subnets**: Select the default subnets (automatically populated).

3. **Security Group**
   - Select the security group created earlier for backend services (`vprofile-backend-sg`).

4. **Encryption**
   - Use **default encryption settings**.

5. **Maintenance**
   - Leave as **default** unless specific custom maintenance windows are required.

---

#### **6. Review and Create**
- **Review Settings**:
  - Ensure the **instance type**, **username**, **password**, and **access type** are correct.
  - Confirm the selected **VPC**, **subnets**, and **security group**.
- Click **Create Broker**.

---

#### **7. Save Broker Details**
- The broker will take a few minutes to be created.
- Once created:
  - Note the **Broker Endpoint** for integration with the application.
  - Test connectivity within the private VPC environment if needed.

---

#### **8. Next Steps**
- Proceed to initialize the database:
  - Extract the schema from the source code.
  - Apply the schema to the RDS instance created earlier.
- Continue to the next steps for database initialization.
