### **Step-by-Step Guide to Initializing the Database in RDS for the VProfile Project**

---

#### **1. Verify RDS Instance**
1. Go to the **RDS Dashboard** in the AWS Management Console.
2. Verify that the **DB Instance** is in the **Available** status.
3. Note down the **Endpoint** and **Port Number (3306)**.

---

#### **2. Accessing the Private RDS Instance**
- The RDS instance is private and cannot be accessed publicly.  
- To initialize the database, launch an EC2 instance in the same VPC as the RDS instance.

---

#### **3. Launch an EC2 Instance**
1. Navigate to the **EC2 Dashboard** and click on **Launch Instance**.
2. **Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI):**
   - Select an **Ubuntu 24.x** image.
3. **Instance Type:**
   - Choose `t2.micro` for this temporary instance.
4. **Key Pair:**
   - Select the existing key pair or create a new one to access the instance via SSH.
5. **Security Group:**
   - Create a new security group for this instance:
     - Name: `vprofile-mysql-client-sg`.
     - Inbound Rule: Allow **SSH (Port 22)** from **Your IP** to connect via SSH.
6. **Launch the Instance:**
   - Click **Launch Instance** and wait for it to start.
7. **Note the Public IP Address** of the instance for SSH access.

---

#### **4. Connect to the EC2 Instance**
1. Open your terminal.
2. Use the following command to SSH into the instance:
   ```
   ssh -i <path-to-your-key-file> ubuntu@<public-ip-address>
   ```
3. Switch to the root user:
   ```
   sudo -i
   ```

---

#### **5. Install Required Tools**
- Update and install the **MySQL Client** and **Git**:
  ```
  apt update && apt install mysql-client git -y
  ```

---

#### **6. Configure Security Group for RDS Access**
1. **Allow EC2 to Access RDS:**
   - Navigate to the **RDS Security Group** in the EC2 Dashboard.
   - Edit **Inbound Rules**:
     - Add a rule to allow **MySQL/Aurora (Port 3306)** from the **EC2 Security Group (vprofile-mysql-client-sg)**.
2. Save the rules.

---

#### **7. Log in to RDS from EC2**
1. Obtain the RDS **endpoint**, username, and password.
2. Log in using the MySQL Client:
   ```
   mysql -h <rds-endpoint> -u <username> -p
   ```
   - Enter the password when prompted.
3. Use the database:
   ```
   USE accounts;
   ```
4. Verify connection by listing tables (if any):
   ```
   SHOW TABLES;
   ```

---

#### **8. Clone the Source Code**
1. Navigate to **GitHub** and open the repository for the VProfile project:
   - URL: `https://github.com/<repo-owner>/vprofile-project`
2. Copy the repositoryâ€™s HTTPS link.
3. Clone the repository in the EC2 instance:
   ```
   git clone <https-repo-link>
   ```
4. Navigate to the cloned repository directory:
   ```
   cd vprofile-project
   ```
5. Switch to the branch `AWS-refactor`:
   ```
   git checkout AWS-refactor
   ```

---

#### **9. Initialize the Database Schema**
1. Locate the **SQL backup file**:
   - Path: `src/main/resources/db_backup.sql`
2. Deploy the schema using the MySQL Client:
   ```
   mysql -h <rds-endpoint> -u <username> -p < accounts < src/main/resources/db_backup.sql
   ```
3. Verify schema deployment:
   ```
   SHOW TABLES;
   ```
   - Ensure the necessary tables are created.

---

#### **10. Terminate the EC2 Instance**
1. Go back to the **EC2 Dashboard**.
2. Select the temporary instance.
3. Click on **Instance State > Terminate Instance**.
   - This instance was only needed to initialize the database.

---

#### **11. Summary**
- The database is now initialized and ready for use with the VProfile application.
- Since the RDS instance is private, the database setup was done using a temporary EC2 instance in the same VPC.

---

#### **Next Steps**
- Proceed to create a Beanstalk instance to host the VProfile application.
