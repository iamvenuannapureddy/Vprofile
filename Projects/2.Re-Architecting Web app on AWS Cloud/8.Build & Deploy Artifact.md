**Steps to Deploy the Artifact and Configure Backend Services**

### **Preparation**
1. **Collect Backend Service Information:**
   - **RDS Endpoint:** Access the RDS instance, copy the endpoint, and note it down.
   - **Amazon MQ:** Navigate to the Amazon MQ broker. Copy the connection URL (after `//`) and note the port number (default: `5671`). Ensure the port matches the application configuration.
   - **ElastiCache:** Go to the Memcached configuration and copy the endpoint. Note the port number (default: `11211`).
   - **Credentials:** Ensure you have the username and password for RabbitMQ and other services.

2. **Prepare the Application Configuration File:**
   - Clone the source code from the repository (e.g., GitHub) using the HTTPS URL.
   - Use Visual Studio Code or your preferred IDE to modify `application.properties` under `src/main/resources/`:
     - Update `db.endpoint` with the RDS endpoint (e.g., `jdbc:mysql://<RDS-Endpoint>:3306`).
     - Update `memcache.endpoint` with the Memcached endpoint.
     - Update `rabbitmq.endpoint` and `port` to match the RabbitMQ configuration (e.g., `5671`).
     - Ensure all usernames and passwords are correctly set.
     - Save the file.

### **Building the Artifact**
3. **Clone Repository:**
   - Clone the repository into your local machine using Visual Studio Code:
     - Click **Source Control > Clone Repository**.
     - Paste the repository URL and select the destination folder.
   - Switch to the appropriate branch (e.g., `AWS-refactor`).

4. **Verify Maven and Java Versions:**
   - Open the terminal in your IDE.
   - Check the Maven and Java versions:
     ```bash
     mvn -version
     ```
     - Maven should be version `3.9.9` or higher.
     - Java should be version `17` or higher.
   - If incorrect versions are installed:
     - On Windows, use `choco` commands to uninstall and install the correct versions.
     - On Mac, use `brew` commands.

5. **Build the Artifact:**
   - Run the following command to build the application:
     ```bash
     mvn install
     ```
   - Upon success, a `target` folder will be created containing the artifact (e.g., `vprofile-v2.war`).

### **Deploying to Elastic Beanstalk**
6. **Upload and Deploy the Artifact:**
   - Navigate to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.
   - Select **Upload and Deploy**, then:
     - Choose the artifact file (e.g., `vprofile-v2.war`) from the `target` folder.
     - Assign a version label (e.g., `vprofile-rearch-v1.9`).
     - Deploy with the default rolling deployment policy (batch size: 50%).
   - Monitor deployment progress under **Events**.

7. **Verify Deployment:**
   - Check the Elastic Beanstalk environment URL.
   - Confirm the application loads successfully and backend connectivity is operational.

### **Securing the Application with HTTPS**
8. **Add ACM Certificate:**
   - Go to **Configuration** in the Elastic Beanstalk environment.
   - Under **Load Balancer Settings**, add a listener:
     - Protocol: HTTPS
     - Port: 443
     - Select the ACM certificate.
   - Apply changes.

9. **Update DNS Records:**
   - Go to your domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy).
   - Add a CNAME record:
     - Name: `<custom-subdomain>` (e.g., `vprofile-rearch`)
     - Value: Elastic Beanstalk endpoint.
   - Save the record.

10. **Verify HTTPS Setup:**
    - Wait for DNS propagation.
    - Access the application via the custom HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://vprofile-rearch.<domain-name>`).
    - Confirm the connection is secure and the certificate is valid.

### **Application Testing**
11. **Login to the Application:**
    - Use credentials (e.g., `admin_vp / admin_vp`) to log in.
    - Verify database connectivity and page loading.

12. **Test Backend Services:**
    - Verify data insertion into Memcached.
    - Confirm RabbitMQ integration.

### **Next Steps**
13. **Global Traffic Distribution with CloudFront:**
    - Configure Amazon CloudFront to distribute application traffic globally.
    - Ensure improved performance and reduced latency for global users.

**Congratulations!** You have successfully deployed the application using Elastic Beanstalk, integrated backend services, secured the application with HTTPS, and prepared it for global distribution.
