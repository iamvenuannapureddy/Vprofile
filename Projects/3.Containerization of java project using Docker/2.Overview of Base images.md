### **Steps to Containerize a Project: Professional Notes**

---

#### **Step 1: Understand the Project's Services, Tools, and Versions**
1. **Objective**: Identify all the services, tools, and software used in the project along with their versions.
2. **Action**:  
   - Prepare a list of the services and tools used in the project.
   - Note the versions of each service/tool to ensure compatibility during containerization.
   - Gather this information from developers or project documentation.

---

#### **Step 2: Review the Project Setup**
1. **Objective**: Familiarize yourself with the project's manual setup process.
2. **Action**:  
   - Refer to the project documentation (e.g., PDF setup guide for the “VProfile” project).
   - Identify:
     - Services involved (e.g., MySQL, Memcache, RabbitMQ, Tomcat, Nginx).
     - Configuration changes or commands used (e.g., SQL commands, user creation, privilege grants, etc.).
   - Understand the dependencies:
     - Tools like JDK and Maven used to build artifacts.
   - If needed, manually set up the project in virtual machines to comprehend the process better.

#### **Step 3: Explore Official Docker Images**
1. **Objective**: Identify the official Docker images for the services used in the project and find the closest matching version tags.
2. **Action**:
   - Visit [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).
   - Search for each service (e.g., MySQL, Tomcat) and locate its official Docker image.
   - Match the service version with the appropriate Docker image tag.  
     **Example**:
     - MySQL: Locate the `8.0.33` tag.
     - Memcache: `1.6` can use the `latest` tag as it matches.
     - Tomcat: Version `10` with JDK `21` tag found as `10-jdk21`.
   - Document all image names and tags for future use.

   **List of Docker Images for VProfile Project**:
   | **Service**    | **Version** | **Docker Image Tag**                                      |
   |----------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
   | MySQL          | 8.0.33      | `mysql:8.0.33`                                           |
   | Memcache       | 1.6         | `memcached:latest`                                       |
   | RabbitMQ       | 4.0         | `rabbitmq:latest`                                        |
   | Maven          | 3.9.9 (JDK21) | `maven:3.9.9-eclipse-temurin-21-jammy`                |
   | Tomcat         | 10 (JDK21)  | `tomcat:10-jdk21`                                        |
   | Nginx          | 1.27        | `nginx:latest`                                           |

#### **Step 4: Review Docker Image Documentation**
1. **Objective**: Understand how to configure and customize Docker images.
2. **Action**:  
   - For each service, read its official Docker documentation on Docker Hub.
   - Note specific settings, configurations, and environment variables required.
     **Example**:
     - MySQL:
       - Set `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` for root access.
       - Use `-v` (volume) to inject SQL files or configuration into the container.
     - Tomcat:
       - Inject artifacts (WAR files) built by Maven into the webapps directory.
     - Nginx:
       - Upload custom configuration files to the appropriate directory using `-v`.

---

#### **Step 5: Assignment and Preparation**
1. **Objective**: Strengthen understanding of the manual setup and Docker images.
2. **Tasks**:
   1. Go through the manual project setup document (e.g., VProfile setup guide).
      - Understand the commands, configurations, and steps for each service.
   2. Explore Docker Hub for each service.
      - Find official images and read their documentation.
      - Note configuration methods, required environment variables, and customization options.

#### **Key Notes for Real-Time Projects**
1. **Testing Docker Tags**: 
   - If the exact version is unavailable, try the closest tag and test its compatibility.
   - Test multiple tags to find the best fit.
2. **Customization**: 
   - Customize official images to meet project requirements (e.g., injecting SQL files, configuration files, or artifacts).
3. **Documentation**: 
   - Keep a well-documented list of services, versions, Docker image names, tags, and configurations.

---

#### **Outcome**
By following these steps, you will:
- Be ready to write Dockerfiles.
- Have the required Docker images with appropriate tags.
- Know how to customize and configure containers to align with the project’s requirements.
