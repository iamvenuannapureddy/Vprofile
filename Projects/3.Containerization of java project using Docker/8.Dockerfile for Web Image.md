### Setting Up the Nginx Docker Image and Using Official Images for Memcached and RabbitMQ  

#### Step 1: Understanding the Nginx Setup  
1. **Manual Configuration Review**  
   - In the manual setup, we installed the Nginx service and added a custom configuration file.  
   - The configuration specified that requests on port `80` should be routed to the backend on port `8080`.  

2. **Customizing the Official Nginx Docker Image**  
   - Go to the [official Nginx Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx).  
   - There are two options for configuration:  
     - **Inject at Runtime**: Use a volume to mount the custom configuration during container runtime.  
     - **Embed Configuration in Image**: Build a custom image with the configuration baked in.  
   - For simplicity and consistency in this project, we embed the configuration directly in the custom image.

#### Step 2: Writing the Nginx Dockerfile  
1. **Base Image**  
   - Use the official Nginx image as the base image (`nginx`).  
   - Default to the latest tag for simplicity.  

2. **Add Labels**  
   - Use labels to identify the project and team. Example:  
     ```
     LABEL project="your_project_name"  
     LABEL team="your_team_name"  
     ```  

3. **Remove Default Configuration**  
   - Use the `RUN` instruction to remove the default Nginx configuration:  
     ```dockerfile  
     RUN rm -rf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf  
     ```  

4. **Add Custom Configuration**  
   - Copy the custom Nginx configuration file (`nginx.conf`) to the appropriate directory:  
     ```dockerfile  
     COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/  
     ```  

5. **Resulting Dockerfile**:  
   ```dockerfile  
   FROM nginx  
   
   LABEL project="your_project_name"  
   LABEL team="your_team_name"  
   
   RUN rm -rf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf  
   COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/  
   ```  

#### Step 3: Handling Memcached  
1. **Manual Setup Recap**  
   - In the manual setup, we installed Memcached and started the service.  
   - Memcached operates on port `11211` by default.  

2. **Using the Official Image**  
   - Visit the [Memcached Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/_/memcached).  
   - Memcached stores data in runtime memory and requires no custom configuration for this project.  
   - Use the official image directly without creating a custom Dockerfile.  
   - Example usage:  
     ```yaml  
     image: memcached  
     ports:  
       - "11211:11211"  
     ```  

#### Step 4: Handling RabbitMQ  
1. **Manual Setup Recap**  
   - Installed RabbitMQ, created a user (`test`), and assigned an administrator tag.  
   - For this project, the default user (`guest`) and password (`guest`) are sufficient based on the `application.properties` file.  

2. **Using the Official Image**  
   - Visit the [RabbitMQ Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq).  
   - The RabbitMQ default user (`guest`) and password (`guest`) match the project's configuration.  
   - Use the official image directly without modification.  
   - Example usage:  
     ```yaml  
     image: rabbitmq  
     ports:  
       - "5672:5672"  
       - "15672:15672"  # RabbitMQ management UI  
     ```  

#### Step 5: Summary of Dockerfiles and Images Used  
1. **Custom Dockerfiles Created**:  
   - **App Image**: Handles application setup.  
   - **DB Image**: Customizes MySQL with specific environment variables and database initialization.  
   - **Nginx Image**: Embeds custom configuration to route traffic.  

2. **Official Images Used**:  
   - **Memcached**: No customization required. Use the official image directly.  
   - **RabbitMQ**: Use the official image with the default username and password.  

#### Step 6: Next Steps  
- In the next session, we will create a `docker-compose.yml` file to orchestrate all these services.  
- This will include building custom images and running containers together for seamless application testing.
