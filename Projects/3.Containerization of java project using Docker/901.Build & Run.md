# **Docker Compose Workflow: Building, Running, and Cleaning Up Containers**

## **Step 1: Power On the Vagrant Virtual Machine**
1. Navigate to the directory where the Vagrant VM was created and Docker Engine installed (e.g., `F:\containerization\wipro_project\vagrant_windows`).
2. Open Git Bash or a terminal in this directory.
3. Check the VM status using:
   ```bash
   vagrant status
   ```
4. If the VM is powered off, start it with:
   ```bash
   vagrant up
   ```
5. If the VM is already running, reload it:
   ```bash
   vagrant reload
   ```

## **Step 2: SSH Into the VM**
1. SSH into the running VM:
   ```bash
   vagrant ssh
   ```
2. (Optional) Switch to the root user:
   ```bash
   sudo -i
   ```
3. Navigate to the shared Vagrant folder:
   ```bash
   cd /vagrant
   ```

## **Step 3: Transfer Files**
1. Copy the **Dockerfiles** folder and the **docker-compose.yml** file into the `/vagrant` directory.
   - Ensure that all required files are in the `/vagrant` folder (shared directory).

## **Step 4: Build Docker Images**
1. Navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file.
2. Run the following command to build all Docker images:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```
3. Verify the built images:
   ```bash
   docker images
   ```
   - You should see images for `app`, `db`, and `web`.

## **Step 5: Run Docker Containers**
1. Start the containers using the following command:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
2. Docker Compose will:
   - Check for the images locally.
   - Pull official images for **Memcache** and **RabbitMQ** if not available.
   - Create a Docker network, volumes, and containers.

## **Step 6: Verify Container Setup**
1. List the running containers:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
   - Verify the container names (e.g., `wipro_db`, `wipro_app`, `wipro_web`, `wipro_cache_01`, `wipro_mq_01`).

2. If container names are incorrect:
   - Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to include:
     ```yaml
     container_name: wipro_cache_01  # For Memcache
     container_name: wipro_mq_01     # For RabbitMQ
     ```
   - Stop and remove containers:
     ```bash
     docker-compose down
     ```
   - Rebuild and start the containers:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

## **Step 7: Access the Application**
1. Obtain the VMâ€™s IP address:
   ```bash
   ip addr show
   ```
   - Look for the `enp0s8` interface (e.g., `192.168.56.16`).

2. Open a browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://<VM_IP>:80
   ```
3. Log in using:
   - Username: `admin_vp`
   - Password: `admin_vp`

4. Verify the application functionality:
   - Check RabbitMQ: Click on the RabbitMQ link.
   - Check Memcache: View user data caching by clicking on a user twice (data should load from the cache on the second attempt).

## **Step 8: Push Docker Images to Docker Hub**
1. Log in to your Docker Hub account:
   ```bash
   docker login
   ```
   - If prompted, complete browser-based authentication.

2. Tag and push each image to Docker Hub:
   ```bash
   docker tag <image_id> <docker_hub_username>/<image_name>
   docker push <docker_hub_username>/<image_name>
   ```
   - Example:
     ```bash
     docker tag wipro_app <docker_hub_username>/wipro_app
     docker push <docker_hub_username>/wipro_app
     ```

3. Repeat the process for `db` and `web` images.

## **Step 9: Clean Up**
1. Stop and remove all containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```
2. Remove volumes:
   ```bash
   docker volume ls
   docker volume rm <volume_name>
   # Or prune unused volumes:
   docker volume prune
   ```
3. Perform a complete system cleanup:
   ```bash
   docker system prune -a
   ```
   - This will remove all containers, images, networks, and unused cache.

## **Step 10: Shutdown or Destroy the VM**
1. To stop the VM:
   ```bash
   vagrant halt
   ```
2. To destroy the VM:
   ```bash
   vagrant destroy
   ```

## **Key Notes**
- Keep the `docker-compose.yml`, Dockerfiles, and Vagrantfile in the shared directory (`/vagrant`) for reproducibility.
- The setup can be re-created anytime by bringing up the VM and running `docker-compose` commands.
- These Docker images can be reused later in Kubernetes projects.
