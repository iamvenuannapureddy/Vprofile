### Step-by-Step Guide to Writing a Multi-Stage Dockerfile for the Application Image  

#### Prerequisites  
- Install **VSCode** as your editor.  
- Clone the source code repository (ensure you are on the correct branch, such as `containers`).  
- Understand the folder structure: inside the repository, locate the `docker-files` folder. This folder contains subfolders like `app`, `db`, and `web`, each with an empty `Dockerfile`.  

---

#### Objective  
To create a **multi-stage Dockerfile** for the `app` image using Tomcat as the base image. The artifact will be built using Maven and then deployed on the Tomcat server.

---

### Steps to Create the Dockerfile  

#### 1. **Set Up the Multi-Stage Dockerfile**  
In the `app/Dockerfile`, define a multi-stage build to separate the artifact-building stage from the artifact-hosting stage:  
- **First Stage**: Use Maven to build the application artifact.  
- **Second Stage**: Use Tomcat to host the built artifact.  

---

#### 2. **First Stage: Build the Artifact with Maven**  
1. **Base Image**: Use an official Maven image as the base:  
   ```dockerfile
   FROM maven:3.9.9 AS build_image
   ```  
2. **Clone the Source Code**: Clone the repository using the `RUN` instruction. Combine multiple commands for efficiency:  
   ```dockerfile
   RUN git clone <repository-url> && \
       cd vprofile-project && \
       git checkout containers && \
       mvn install
   ```  
   - This clones the repository, switches to the correct branch, and builds the artifact with `mvn install`.  
   - Note: Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual Git repository URL.  

3. **Artifact Location**: After the build, the artifact will be located in:  
   ```
   /vprofile-project/target/vprofile-v2.war
   ```

---

#### 3. **Second Stage: Host the Artifact in Tomcat**  
1. **Base Image**: Use the official Tomcat image as the base:  
   ```dockerfile
   FROM tomcat:9.0.73
   ```  

2. **Remove Default Applications**: Remove default applications from the Tomcat `webapps` folder:  
   ```dockerfile
   RUN rm -rf /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/*
   ```  

3. **Copy Artifact**: Copy the built artifact from the first stage into the `webapps` folder:  
   ```dockerfile
   COPY --from=build_image /vprofile-project/target/vprofile-v2.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war
   ```  
   - `--from=build_image` specifies that the artifact is copied from the first stage.  

4. **Optional Configuration**:  
   - **Expose Port**: Expose port 8080 (default for Tomcat):  
     ```dockerfile
     EXPOSE 8080
     ```  
   - **Command to Start Tomcat**: Define the default command to start the Tomcat service (optional, as it is included by default in the base image):  
     ```dockerfile
     CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
     ```  

---

#### 4. **Why Use Multi-Stage Builds?**  
- **Efficiency**: Keeps the final image lightweight by excluding unnecessary dependencies like Maven and its libraries.  
- **Best Practices**: Separates the build environment from the runtime environment.  

For example:  
- The **first stage** (Maven) is only used to generate the artifact.  
- The **second stage** (Tomcat) contains only what is necessary to run the application.

---

#### 5. **Final Dockerfile**  
The complete `Dockerfile` for the `app` image:  
```dockerfile
# First Stage: Build the artifact
FROM maven:3.9.9 AS build_image
RUN git clone <repository-url> && \
    cd vprofile-project && \
    git checkout containers && \
    mvn install

# Second Stage: Host the artifact in Tomcat
FROM tomcat:9.0.73
RUN rm -rf /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/*
COPY --from=build_image /vprofile-project/target/vprofile-v2.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
```

---

#### 6. **Build the Docker Image**  
After writing the `Dockerfile`, follow these steps to build the Docker image:  
1. Open a terminal in the `app` folder where the `Dockerfile` is located.  
2. Run the following command to build the image:  
   ```bash
   docker build -t <dockerhub-account-name>/profile-app .
   ```  
   - Replace `<dockerhub-account-name>` with your Docker Hub account name.  

---

#### 7. **Verify the Image**  
1. Run the container:  
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8080:8080 <dockerhub-account-name>/profile-app
   ```  
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see your deployed application.

---

### Next Steps  
1. Write Dockerfiles for `db` and `web` images following a similar process.  
2. Push all built images to Docker Hub.  
3. Test the end-to-end deployment with all components.
