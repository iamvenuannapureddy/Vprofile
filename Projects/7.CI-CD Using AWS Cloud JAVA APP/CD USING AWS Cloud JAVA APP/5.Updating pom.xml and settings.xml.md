### **Updating `pom.xml` and `settings.xml` for Maven Dependencies**

---

In this lecture, we will update the `pom.xml` and `settings.xml` files to configure Maven to download dependencies from AWS CodeArtifact. 

---

### **Step 1: Retrieve CodeArtifact URL**
1. Open **AWS CodeArtifact** in the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the CodeArtifact repository created in the previous project (**Continuous Integration on AWS**).
3. Under **Connection Instructions**, select **Package: Maven**.
4. Copy the CodeArtifact **repository URL**.
   - Ensure you copy the entire URL, including the backward slash (`/`) at the end.

---

### **Step 2: Update `pom.xml`**
1. Open your project source code repository.
   - Navigate to the branch: `cd-aws`.
2. Locate and open the `pom.xml` file.
3. Scroll to the section where the **repository URL** is specified (at the end of the file).
4. Replace the dummy URL with the CodeArtifact URL:
   - Remove the existing dummy URL.
   - Paste the CodeArtifact URL and ensure:
     - The URL contains **only one backward slash** (`/`) at the end.
     - The URL closes correctly without any extra spaces or characters.
5. Commit the changes:
   - Provide a meaningful commit message, such as:
     ```plaintext
     Updated pom.xml with CodeArtifact repository URL
     ```

---

### **Step 3: Update `settings.xml`**
1. In the same branch (`cd-aws`), locate and open the `settings.xml` file.
2. Replace the existing dummy URLs with the CodeArtifact URL:
   - Locate both occurrences of the URL in `settings.xml`.
   - Replace them with the correct CodeArtifact URL.
3. Verify the format:
   - Ensure the URL is properly formatted in both places, including backward slashes and any required parameters.
4. Commit the changes:
   - Provide a meaningful commit message, such as:
     ```plaintext
     Updated settings.xml with CodeArtifact repository URL
     ```

---

### **Summary**
- **Updated `pom.xml`**: Replaced the dummy Maven repository URL with the correct CodeArtifact repository URL.
- **Updated `settings.xml`**: Replaced the dummy URLs in two locations with the correct CodeArtifact repository URL.
- **Next Steps**: Create a CodeBuild job to fetch the source code and build the artifact.

This concludes the process of updating `pom.xml` and `settings.xml`.
