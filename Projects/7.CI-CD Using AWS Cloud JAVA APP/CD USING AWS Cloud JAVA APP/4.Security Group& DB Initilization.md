### **Initializing the RDS Instance and Setting Up the Database Schema**

---

### **Step 1: Retrieve the RDS Endpoint**
1. Navigate to your RDS instance in the AWS Management Console.
2. Copy the **RDS endpoint** from the instance details and save it securely (e.g., in Sticky Notes).

---

### **Step 2: Identify and Prepare the Database Schema**
1. Go to the source code repository:
   - URL: `https://github.com/coder/vprofile-project`.
   - Switch to the branch `cd-aws`.
   - Navigate to the file: `src/main/resources/dbbackup.sql`.
2. This file contains the SQL schema that needs to be executed on the RDS instance.

---

### **Step 3: Allow RDS Connectivity from Beanstalk Instance**
1. Open the **RDS security group** in the AWS Management Console:
   - Go to the **EC2 Console** → **Security Groups**.
   - Locate the RDS security group (e.g., `vprofile-ci-cd-rds-mysql-sg`).
2. Modify the **inbound rules**:
   - Add a new rule:
     - Type: **MySQL/Aurora**.
     - Port: **3306**.
     - Source: **Beanstalk Instance Security Group** (ensure it is not the load balancer security group).
   - Save the updated rule.

---

### **Step 4: Access the Beanstalk Instance**
1. In the **Elastic Beanstalk** environment, ensure at least one instance is running.
   - If needed, adjust the instance settings:
     - Go to **Elastic Beanstalk Console** → **Configuration** → **Instance** → **Traffic and Scaling**.
     - Edit the settings to maintain at least one running instance.
     - Save and apply changes.
2. Copy the **public IP address** of a running Beanstalk instance.
3. SSH into the Beanstalk instance:
   - Use the command:
     ```bash
     ssh -i /path/to/key.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>
     ```
   - Replace `/path/to/key.pem` with your key pair file path and `<public-ip>` with the instance’s public IP address.
4. Secure SSH access:
   - In the instance’s security group, restrict **port 22** to your IP only:
     - Go to **EC2 Console** → **Security Groups** → **Inbound Rules**.
     - Edit the rule for port 22 to allow access from **My IP**.
     - Save the changes.

---

### **Step 5: Install MySQL Client on the Beanstalk Instance**
1. Switch to the root user:
   ```bash
   sudo -i
   ```
2. Install MariaDB client:
   ```bash
   dnf install mariadb105 -y
   ```
3. Verify the installation:
   - Run the command `mysql`. If successful, the MySQL client will open.

---

### **Step 6: Connect to the RDS Instance**
1. Use the MySQL client to connect to the RDS instance:
   ```bash
   mysql -h <RDS-endpoint> -u admin -p accounts
   ```
   - Replace `<RDS-endpoint>` with your RDS endpoint.
   - Enter the **password** when prompted.
2. Verify the connection:
   - Run:
     ```sql
     SHOW TABLES;
     ```
   - The result should be empty initially.

---

### **Step 7: Download the SQL File**
1. Go to the `dbbackup.sql` file in the source code repository.
   - Navigate to: `https://github.com/coder/vprofile-project`.
   - Switch to branch `cd-aws`.
   - Go to `src/main/resources/dbbackup.sql`.
   - Click on **Raw** to get the direct download link.
2. Download the file to the Beanstalk instance:
   ```bash
   wget <raw-sql-file-url>
   ```
   - Replace `<raw-sql-file-url>` with the link copied from GitHub.
3. Verify the file is downloaded:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```
   - You should see the `dbbackup.sql` file.

---

### **Step 8: Initialize the Database**
1. Execute the SQL file on the RDS instance:
   ```bash
   mysql -h <RDS-endpoint> -u admin -p accounts < dbbackup.sql
   ```
   - Replace `<RDS-endpoint>` with your RDS endpoint.
2. Verify the initialization:
   - Log in to the RDS instance again:
     ```bash
     mysql -h <RDS-endpoint> -u admin -p accounts
     ```
   - Check the tables:
     ```sql
     SHOW TABLES;
     ```
   - You should see the initialized tables.

---

### **Summary**
- **Configured RDS Security Group**: Allowed connectivity from the Beanstalk instance’s security group.
- **Initialized the Database**: Executed the schema file (`dbbackup.sql`) to create the required tables.
- **Next Steps**: Proceed to configure the source code and set up the CI/CD pipeline.

--- 

This completes the RDS initialization and database setup process.
