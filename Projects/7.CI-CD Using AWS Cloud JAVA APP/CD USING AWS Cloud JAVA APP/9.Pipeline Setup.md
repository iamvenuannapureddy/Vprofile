### Setting Up and Executing the Complete CI/CD Pipeline in AWS CodePipeline: A Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. **Prepare the Required Resources**
   Before creating the pipeline, ensure you have the following resources ready:
   - **Elastic Beanstalk environment**: Deployed and ready.
   - **RDS instance**: Deployed and connected to the application.
   - **CodeBuild projects**:
     - *Build and Release*: Deploys the artifact to Elastic Beanstalk.
     - *Software Testing*: Executes the Selenium test suite.
   - **S3 bucket**: Used to store intermediate build artifacts and test results.

#### 2. **Create the AWS CodePipeline**
   1. **Navigate to CodePipeline Service:**
      - Open AWS Management Console and go to the **CodePipeline** service.

   2. **Start Creating the Pipeline:**
      - Click on **Create Pipeline**.
      - Provide a pipeline name, e.g., `VProfile-CI-CD-Pipeline`.
      - Choose **Create New Service Role** to allow the pipeline to access other services.
      - Click **Next**.

#### 3. **Configure the Source Stage**
   1. **Source Provider:**
      - Select **Bitbucket** as the source provider.
      - Select your Bitbucket connection or create one if not available (follow the previous steps to connect to Bitbucket).
   2. **Repository and Branch:**
      - Select the repository hosting your code.
      - Specify the branch as `CD-AWS`.
   3. **Additional Settings:**
      - Leave **Trigger Type** as default (e.g., "CodePipeline Default").
      - Click **Next**.

#### 4. **Add Stages to the Pipeline**
   - Each stage represents a specific task in the CI/CD process. Follow the steps below to add and configure each stage.

---

#### **Stage 1: Code Analysis**
   1. **Add Stage:**
      - Click **Add Stage** and name it `Code Analysis`.
   2. **Add Action Group:**
      - Click **Add Action Group**, and:
        - **Action Name**: `Code Analysis`.
        - **Action Provider**: Select **CodeBuild**.
        - **Input Artifact**: `Source Artifact`.
        - **Project Name**: Select your **Code Analysis** CodeBuild project.
        - No output artifacts are required since the results are stored on SonarCloud.
      - Click **Done**.

---

#### **Stage 2: Build and Store**
   1. **Add Stage:**
      - Click **Add Stage** and name it `Build and Store`.
   2. **Add Action Group:**
      - **Action Name**: `Build and Store`.
      - **Action Provider**: Select **CodeBuild**.
      - **Input Artifact**: `Source Artifact`.
      - **Project Name**: Select the **Build Artifact** CodeBuild project.
      - **Output Artifact**: `BuildArtifact`.
      - Click **Done**.

---

#### **Stage 3: Deploy to S3**
   1. **Add Stage:**
      - Click **Add Stage** and name it `Deploy to S3`.
   2. **Add Action Group:**
      - **Action Name**: `Deploy to S3`.
      - **Action Provider**: Select **Amazon S3**.
      - **Input Artifact**: `BuildArtifact` (output of the previous stage).
      - **S3 Bucket**: Choose or create a bucket to store the artifacts.
      - Enable **Extract Before Deploy**.
      - Click **Done**.

---

#### **Stage 4: Build Artifact for Beanstalk**
   1. **Edit Stage:**
      - Name the output artifact for the **Build and Store** stage as `BuildArtifactToBean`.
   2. **Configure Input for Deploy to Beanstalk:**
      - Ensure the **Input Artifact** for the Beanstalk deployment stage is `BuildArtifactToBean`.

---

#### **Stage 5: Deploy to Beanstalk**
   1. **Add Stage:**
      - Name it `Deploy to Beanstalk`.
   2. **Add Action Group:**
      - **Action Name**: `Deploy to Beanstalk`.
      - **Action Provider**: Select **Elastic Beanstalk**.
      - **Application Name**: Select your application.
      - **Environment Name**: Select the target environment.
      - **Input Artifact**: `BuildArtifactToBean`.
      - Click **Done**.

---

#### **Stage 6: Software Testing**
   1. **Add Stage:**
      - Click **Add Stage** and name it `Software Testing`.
   2. **Add Action Group:**
      - **Action Name**: `Software Testing`.
      - **Action Provider**: Select **CodeBuild**.
      - **Input Artifact**: `Source Artifact`.
      - **Project Name**: Select the **Software Testing** CodeBuild project.
      - Click **Done**.

---

#### 5. **Configure Notifications**
   1. **Create Notification Rule:**
      - In the pipeline view, click the dropdown and select **Notification** > **Create Notification Rule**.
      - Provide a name, e.g., `VProfile-CI-CD-Pipeline-Notifications`.
      - Select **All Events**.
      - Use the existing **SNS Topic** (created in a previous project).
      - Click **Submit**.

---

#### 6. **Enable Transitions**
   - If any transitions were disabled during setup, ensure all transitions between stages are enabled by checking for the **Enable Transition** button.

---

#### 7. **Trigger the Pipeline**
   1. **Release Change:**
      - Click **Release Change** to manually trigger the pipeline.
   2. **Monitor Execution:**
      - The pipeline will sequentially execute all stages:
        - **Code Analysis**: Runs the SonarCloud analysis.
        - **Build and Store**: Builds the artifact and stores it in S3.
        - **Deploy to S3**: Deploys the artifact to the specified S3 bucket.
        - **Deploy to Beanstalk**: Deploys the application to Elastic Beanstalk.
        - **Software Testing**: Executes the Selenium test suite.

---

#### 8. **Monitor Logs and Results**
   - Use **CloudWatch Logs** to monitor logs for each CodeBuild project.
   - Check the **S3 bucket** for test results and artifacts.
   - Verify the successful deployment of the application on the Beanstalk environment.
