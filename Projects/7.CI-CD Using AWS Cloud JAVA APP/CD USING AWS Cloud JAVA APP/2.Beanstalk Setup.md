# Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up AWS Elastic Beanstalk Application

## Prerequisites
1. **Complete the Previous Project**: Ensure you have completed the "Continuous Integration on AWS" project. This provides:
   - A working CI pipeline.
   - A Bitbucket repository, which is required for this project.

## Steps to Set Up Elastic Beanstalk Application

### 1. Create a Beanstalk Application
1. **Search for Beanstalk** in the AWS Management Console.
2. **Create a new application**:
   - **Application Name**: Use `weprofile-app`.
   - **Environment Name**: Use `weprofile-app-prod-environment`.
3. **Set the Domain**:
   - Ensure it is in lowercase.
   - Check for domain name availability.
   - Add unique identifiers if needed.

### 2. Select Platform and Configuration
1. **Platform**: Select `Tomcat 10 with Corretto 21`.
2. **Platform Version**: Use the default configuration preset.
3. **Instance Configuration**:
   - Choose `Custom Configuration`.
   - Select `Multiple Instances`.

### 3. Role Configuration
1. **Use an Existing Role**:
   - If you completed the "Re-architecture Web App on AWS" project, use the role created in that project.
   - If not, refer to the "Beanstalk" lecture in that project to create the necessary role.
2. **Select the Profile Role**: Use `bean-role`.

### 4. Key Pair Setup
1. If you have an existing key pair, select it.
2. If not:
   - Go to **EC2 Console**.
   - Navigate to **Key Pairs** and create a new key pair:
     - **Name**: `wipro-bean-cicd`.
     - **File Format**: PEM (private key file).
   - Download the key pair.
   - Refresh the Beanstalk page and select the newly created key pair.

### 5. Configure VPC and Networking
1. **VPC**: Select the default VPC.
2. **Public IP Address**: Activate public IP assignment.
3. **Subnets**: Select all subnets to allow instance launches in any subnet.

### 6. Instance Settings
1. **Instance Type**:
   - Remove `t2.small`.
   - Select `t2.micro` or `t3.micro`.
2. **Instance Capacity**:
   - Set **Minimum Instances** to 2.
   - Set **Maximum Instances** to 4.
3. **Enable Stickiness**:
   - Edit the processes under the load balancer settings.
   - Enable **Stickiness** to ensure session persistence with specific instances.

### 7. Monitoring and Deployment Policy
1. **Monitoring**: Keep all default settings.
2. **Deployment Policy**:
   - Choose `Rolling` deployment.
   - Set the batch size to 50% (e.g., one instance upgraded at a time for 2 instances; two instances for 4 instances).

### 8. Review and Submit
1. Review all selected settings.
2. Make necessary corrections if errors are found.
3. Click **Submit** to create the Beanstalk application.

### 9. Launch RDS Instance
1. Once the Beanstalk application is being created, proceed to launch the RDS instance.
2. Refer to the next lecture for detailed steps on setting up RDS.
