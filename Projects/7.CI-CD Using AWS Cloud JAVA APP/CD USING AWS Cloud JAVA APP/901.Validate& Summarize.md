### Step-by-Step AWS Pipeline and Software Testing Process

1. **Creating AWS CodePipeline**:
   - Navigate to AWS CodePipeline and click on **Create Pipeline**.
   - Provide a name for the pipeline, such as `WeProfile CI/CD Pipeline`.
   - Create a new service role or select an existing one, making sure to set a unique role name.
   - Choose the source provider (e.g., Bitbucket), select the repository, and specify the branch (`CD-AWS`) to detect commits.
   - Select the default CodePipeline trigger (`No filter`), ensuring the pipeline starts with every commit to the specified branch.
   
2. **Setting Up the Build Stage**:
   - Select **AWS CodeBuild** as the build provider.
   - Define the input artifact as the source artifact from Bitbucket.
   - Specify the build project (`Build and Release`).
   - Add a deploy stage for AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
     - Select the Beanstalk application and environment.

3. **Deployment to Elastic Beanstalk**:
   - In the deploy stage, define the input artifact as the build artifact from the previous stage.
   - Deploy to the specified Beanstalk environment.

4. **Software Testing Stage**:
   - Add a new stage named **Software Testing** after deployment to Beanstalk.
   - Configure AWS CodeBuild for software testing.
   - Select the source artifact and specify the Selenium test suite project (`Software Testing`).
   - The software testing stage performs automated testing, capturing screenshots and storing results in an S3 bucket.

5. **Verification and Cleanup**:
   - After successful deployment and testing, review the Beanstalk environment to ensure the application is working correctly.
   - In case of issues (e.g., sticky session configuration), update the settings and retry.
   - Once testing and deployment are verified, proceed with cleanup:
     - Either delete the entire Beanstalk environment or adjust the Auto Scaling group size to zero.
     - Stop or delete the RDS instance if necessary.
     - Delete unused S3 buckets or pipeline resources, ensuring there are no lingering charges.

6. **Reviewing Results**:
   - Verify the output in S3 bucket (e.g., screenshots from Selenium testing) to ensure successful testing.
   - Monitor the pipeline for successful execution and conclude the project once all stages are complete.
