## **Setting Up a CodeBuild Job for Software Testing**

This guide outlines how to configure a CodeBuild job that executes Selenium tests and stores the results in an S3 bucket. This job will run after the deployment job to test the deployed application hosted on Elastic Beanstalk.

---

### **Prerequisites**
Before creating the CodeBuild job, ensure the following:
1. **Service Role**: Retrieve the IAM service role used in the previous build jobs.
2. **S3 Bucket**: Create a new S3 bucket to store test results.
3. **CloudWatch Log Group**: Use the same log group as the previous jobs.
4. **Elastic Beanstalk Endpoint**: Retrieve the Beanstalk environment URL.

---

### **Step 1: Gather Necessary Information**
1. **Retrieve Service Role Name**:
   - Open **CodeBuild** and go to the previous build job.
   - Copy the **IAM service role name**.

2. **Create an S3 Bucket**:
   - Go to **Amazon S3** and click **Create Bucket**.
   - Name the bucket (e.g., `vprofile-ci-cd-selenium-51`). Ensure the name is unique.
   - Select the region where your jobs are running and click **Create Bucket**.

3. **Retrieve CloudWatch Log Group Name**:
   - Navigate to a previous build job in **CodeBuild**.
   - Find and copy the **CloudWatch Log Group Name**.

4. **Retrieve Elastic Beanstalk Endpoint URL**:
   - Go to **Elastic Beanstalk** and select your environment.
   - Copy the **Environment URL**.

---

### **Step 2: Create the CodeBuild Job**
1. Open **AWS CodeBuild** and click **Create Build Project**.

2. **Project Details**:
   - **Project Name**: Enter a name (e.g., `Software-Testing`).

3. **Source**:
   - **Source Provider**: Select **Bitbucket**.
   - **Repository**: Choose the repository containing Selenium test scripts.
   - **Branch**: Specify the branch name as `SeleniumAutoScripts`.

4. **Environment**:
   - **Operating System**: Select **Windows Server**.
   - **Image Version**: Choose **aws/codebuild/windows-base:3.0**.
   - **Service Role**: Select **Existing Service Role** and paste the role name retrieved earlier.

5. **Buildspec File**:
   - Select **Insert Build Commands** and open the editor.
   - Paste the following content from the `buildspec.yml` file located in the `cd-aws` branch:
     ```yaml
     version: 0.2
     phases:
       install:
         commands:
           - powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
           - powershell [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
           - powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
           - choco install jdk11 -y
           - choco install maven -y
           - choco install googlechrome -y
           - choco install git -y
       pre_build:
         commands:
           - mkdir C:/output
           - timeout /t 500
       build:
         commands:
           - cd src/selenium-scripts
           - mvn test -Dbeanstalk.url=<BEANSTALK_URL> -Dusername=admin -Dpassword=admin123
           - copy /y C:/output/* .
     artifacts:
       files:
         - '**/*'
       discard-paths: yes
       base-directory: .
     ```
     Replace `<BEANSTALK_URL>` with the Elastic Beanstalk environment URL.

6. **Artifacts**:
   - **Type**: Select **Amazon S3**.
   - **Bucket Name**: Enter the S3 bucket name (e.g., `vprofile-ci-cd-selenium-51`).
   - Enable **Semantic Versioning**.
   - Ensure artifacts are compressed as a ZIP file.

7. **Logs**:
   - Use the **CloudWatch Log Group Name** from the previous jobs.
   - Specify **Stream Name** as `test-suite`.

8. **Finalize**:
   - Click **Create Build Project**.

### **Step 3: Integrate the Job into the Pipeline**
1. The software testing job will not run independently. Instead, it will be integrated into an **AWS CodePipeline**.
2. The pipeline will trigger the software testing job after:
   - Deploying the application to Elastic Beanstalk.
   - Ensuring the environment is fully ready for testing.
3. The job will:
   - Execute Selenium tests using the provided `buildspec.yml`.
   - Store results (e.g., screenshots and logs) in the S3 bucket.

---

### **Key Notes**
- Use a **500-second delay** to ensure the Elastic Beanstalk environment is fully deployed before testing starts.
- All Selenium test results, screenshots, and logs will be stored in the specified S3 bucket.
- Monitor the **CloudWatch logs** for detailed execution progress and troubleshooting.

In the next step, we will create an **AWS CodePipeline** to combine the build, deploy, and testing stages into a single automated workflow.
