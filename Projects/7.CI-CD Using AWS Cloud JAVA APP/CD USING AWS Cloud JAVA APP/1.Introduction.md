## Continuous Delivery on AWS

#### Introduction
This project focuses on implementing a **Continuous Delivery Pipeline** using AWS PaaS and SaaS services, eliminating the need for EC2 instances or an extensive operations team. The goal is to enable product development teams, working in an agile environment, to efficiently deploy code changes while minimizing operational overhead.

---

#### Scenario
- **Problem Statement:**
  - Developers make regular code changes that need to be built, tested, and deployed quickly.
  - Lack of a dedicated operations team or limited operational knowledge creates bottlenecks.
  - Manual deployment processes lead to delays and dependencies on operational professionals.

- **Solution:**
  - Use AWS-provided PaaS and SaaS services to automate the CI/CD process.
  - Eliminate the need for managing servers (EC2 instances, VMs, etc.) for pre-production environments.
  - Disposable environments can be quickly created, used, and removed to further reduce management overhead.

---

#### Objectives
- **Minimize Operational Overhead:** Leverage AWS services to avoid dependency on an operations team.
- **Reduce MTTR:** Automate deployments for quick issue resolution and fast turnaround time.
- **Agile-Friendly Workflow:** Continuous deployment for every commit with automatic testing and feedback.

### AWS Services Overview

1. **CodeCommit:**
   - Acts as the version control system to store the source code.

2. **CodeArtifact:**
   - Stores and manages Maven dependencies used during the build process.

3. **CodeBuild:**
   - Used for:
     - Building the application artifact.
     - Running SonarCloud scans for code analysis.
     - Executing Selenium tests for software testing.

4. **CodeDeploy:**
   - Deploys the artifact to Elastic Beanstalk.

5. **Elastic Beanstalk:**
   - Hosts the application (PaaS for application hosting).

6. **RDS:**
   - Provides a managed database service for the application.

7. **CodePipeline:**
   - Orchestrates the CI/CD process, integrating all the services seamlessly.

8. **SonarCloud:**
   - Cloud-based SonarQube alternative for code quality analysis.

### Step-by-Step Pipeline Architecture

1. **Developer Commits Code:**
   - Developer pushes code to **CodeCommit**.
   - CodePipeline detects the commit and triggers the pipeline.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - **CodeBuild** runs SonarCloud to analyze the code.
   - Results are stored in SonarCloud.

3. **Dependency Management:**
   - Maven downloads dependencies from **CodeArtifact**.

4. **Build Job:**
   - **CodeBuild** builds the application artifact.
   - Artifact is stored in an **S3 bucket**.

5. **Deployment to Beanstalk:**
   - **CodeDeploy** deploys the artifact to an Elastic Beanstalk environment.
   - **RDS** provides the database connectivity.

6. **Automated Testing:**
   - **CodeBuild** executes Selenium test suites against the Elastic Beanstalk environment.
   - Test results are stored in an **S3 bucket**.

### Comparison with Traditional CI/CD Pipelines

| **Traditional CI/CD Tools** | **AWS PaaS/SaaS Alternatives**   |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| GitHub                      | CodeCommit                       |
| Nexus (Sonatype)            | CodeArtifact                     |
| Jenkins                     | CodeBuild                        |
| SonarQube                   | SonarCloud                       |
| Jenkins Pipeline            | AWS CodePipeline                 |
| Tomcat (on EC2)             | Elastic Beanstalk                |
| Database on VM/EC2          | AWS RDS                          |

### Architectural Diagram Workflow

1. **Trigger:**
   - Developer pushes code to CodeCommit.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - CodeBuild runs a SonarCloud scan.

3. **Dependency Management:**
   - Maven downloads dependencies from CodeArtifact.

4. **Artifact Creation:**
   - CodeBuild compiles the code and creates an artifact.
   - Artifact is stored in an S3 bucket.

5. **Deployment:**
   - CodeDeploy deploys the artifact to Elastic Beanstalk.
   - RDS provides the database.

6. **Testing:**
   - CodeBuild runs Selenium tests against the Beanstalk environment.
   - Test results are stored in an S3 bucket.

### Key Takeaways
- **No Operations Dependency:** Minimal operations overhead by leveraging AWS services.
- **Fully Automated:** The pipeline runs end-to-end without human intervention.
- **Agile and Scalable:** Quickly adapt to code changes with shorter MTTR.
- **Reusable and Disposable Environments:** Enables cost savings and efficient resource management.

---

### Next Steps
- **Create AWS Elastic Beanstalk Environment:**
   - Begin by setting up the Elastic Beanstalk environment as the hosting platform for the application.

- **Follow-Up Tasks:**
   - Integrate all AWS services into CodePipeline.
   - Test and validate the complete pipeline.
