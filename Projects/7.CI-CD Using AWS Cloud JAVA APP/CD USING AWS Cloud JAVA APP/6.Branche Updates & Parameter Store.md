### **Preparation for CodeBuild Job and Deployment**

---

In this lecture, we performed several preparatory steps for the upcoming lecture, where we will create a CodeBuild job to fetch the artifact, build it, and deploy it on Elastic Beanstalk. Below is a detailed breakdown of the steps we completed.

---

### **Step 1: Clean Up the Existing Pipeline**
1. Open **AWS CodePipeline** in the AWS Management Console.
2. Identify the pipeline from the previous project (e.g., **view-profile CI pipeline** or **continuous integration pipeline**).
3. Delete the pipeline, as it is no longer needed.

---

### **Step 2: Update Branches in CodeBuild Projects**
1. Open the **Bitbucket repository**:
   - In the previous project, the branch used was **`ci-aws`**.
   - For this project, switch to the branch **`cd-aws`**.

2. Update the branches in existing CodeBuild projects:
   - Navigate to the **Build Projects** in the AWS Management Console.
   
   **a. Code Analysis Build Project**:
   - Open the existing **Code Analysis Build Project**.
   - Click on **Edit**.
   - Update the branch from **`ci-aws`** to **`cd-aws`**.
   - Save the changes by clicking **Update Project**.

   **b. Artifact Build Project**:
   - Open the **Artifact Build Project** (responsible for building and storing the artifact in S3).
   - Click on **Edit**.
   - Update the branch from **`ci-aws`** to **`cd-aws`**.
   - Save the changes by clicking **Update Project**.

3. Take note of the IAM **Role Name** associated with these build projects:
   - Copy the role name and save it for use in the next lecture.

### **Step 3: Modify Buildspec Files in Bitbucket**
1. In the Bitbucket repository, switch to the branch **`cd-aws`**.
2. Navigate to the folder: **`AWS-files`**.
3. Identify the **three buildspec files**:
   - `sonar_buildspec.yml` (for code analysis).
   - `build_buildspec.yml` (for building artifacts).
   - The third buildspec file (for other project needs).

4. For each file:
   - Open and edit the file.
   - Locate the token or export command sections.
   - Replace them with updated tokens or export commands from the **AWS CodeArtifact** connection instructions:
     - Navigate to **CodeArtifact** > **Repository** > **Connection Instructions**.
     - Select **Maven** > **Operating System: Mac/Linux** > **Maven Pull from Repository**.
     - Copy the **export command** for authentication and paste it into the buildspec files.
   - Verify the YAML syntax to avoid errors (e.g., ensure proper indentation).
   - Commit the changes with meaningful messages, such as:
     ```plaintext
     Updated sonar_buildspec.yml with updated CodeArtifact export commands
     Updated build_buildspec.yml with updated tokens
     ```

---

### **Step 4: Update the Buildspec Path in CodeBuild Projects**
1. In the **`cd-aws`** branch, note that:
   - The `sonar_buildspec.yml` file is located in the `AWS-files` folder.
   - No buildspec file exists in the root directory.

2. Update the **Code Analysis Build Project**:
   - Open the **Code Analysis Build Project** in the AWS Management Console.
   - Click on **Edit**.
   - Under the **Buildspec** section, specify the path to the `sonar_buildspec.yml` file:
     ```
     AWS-files/sonar_buildspec.yml
     ```
   - Save the changes by clicking **Update Project**.

---

### **Step 5: Plan for Upcoming Pipeline Jobs**
In the next lecture, we will create additional build jobs and pipelines. The planned pipeline structure includes four jobs:
1. **Code Analysis Job** (already updated to use the new branch and buildspec path).
2. **Artifact Build Job** (updated with the new branch).
3. **Deployment Job** (to be created, responsible for deploying the artifact to Elastic Beanstalk).
4. **Software Testing Job** (to be created).

---

### **Next Steps**
- In the next lecture, we will:
  - Review the updated buildspec files.
  - Create a new CodeBuild job to deploy the artifact to Elastic Beanstalk.
  - Set up a parameter store for database credentials and other sensitive configurations.

This concludes the preparation steps for the upcoming lecture.
