## AWS Pipeline Service Project - Notes

### Overview:
This project ties together various AWS services to automate the deployment of artifacts to an S3 bucket using AWS CodePipeline.

### Steps:

1. **S3 Bucket Creation**:
   - Navigate to the AWS S3 service.
   - Create a bucket (e.g., `VProfile51-BuildArtifact51`), ensuring the name is unique.
   - Inside the bucket, create a folder named `pipeline-artifacts` (key) to store the build artifacts.

2. **Simple Notification Service (SNS)**:
   - Navigate to AWS SNS and create a new topic (e.g., `VProfilePipelineNotifications`).
   - Create a subscription for email notifications, specifying the desired email address (e.g., Gmail).
   - Confirm the subscription by following the confirmation email sent from AWS.

3. **AWS CodePipeline Setup**:
   - Navigate to AWS CodePipeline in Developer Tools or search for it.
   - Create a new pipeline (e.g., `VProfile-CI-Pipeline`).
   - Specify a service role or create a new one for the pipeline.
   - Choose **Bitbucket** as the source provider to track commits in the repository.
   
4. **Connect Bitbucket Repository**:
   - Establish a connection with Bitbucket by selecting the repository and branch (e.g., `CI-AWS`).
   - Use a no-filter configuration to trigger the pipeline on any push.

5. **CodeBuild for Artifact Creation**:
   - Add a CodeBuild stage to handle the artifact generation from the source repository.
   - Select the Build Artifact project for this stage.

6. **Sonar Code Analysis**:
   - Integrate a SonarQube analysis stage to perform code quality checks.
   
7. **Deploying Artifacts to S3**:
   - Add a deploy stage to move build artifacts from CodeBuild to the S3 bucket (`pipeline-artifacts`).
   - Select the appropriate bucket and key for deployment, ensuring artifacts are extracted before deployment.

8. **Pipeline Notification Setup**:
   - In the pipeline settings, create a notification rule for various pipeline events (e.g., success, failure).
   - Attach the SNS topic created earlier to receive notifications, ensuring email subscribers receive updates.

9. **Pipeline Execution**:
   - Save the pipeline configuration and release changes.
   - Trigger the pipeline by making a commit in the Bitbucket repository, which will initiate the build, analysis, and deployment process.
   
10. **Testing**:
    - Once the pipeline completes, verify the deployment of artifacts to the S3 bucket and ensure notifications are received as expected.

### Summary:
This setup integrates AWS services for CI/CD, including artifact creation, analysis, deployment, and notifications, streamlining the release process.
