## AWS CodeBuild Project for Sonar Code Analysis and Upload to SonarCloud

#### Overview:
- **AWS CodeBuild** is a fully managed build service in AWS where you only pay for the build time you use.
- CodeBuild handles scalability, compute resource management, and other infrastructure needs, reducing administrative overhead.
- This guide focuses on setting up a CodeBuild project to run Sonar code analysis and upload results to SonarCloud.

### Steps:

#### 1. Preparing Buildspec Files

**Pom.xml Changes**:
- Open `pom.xml` in your VSCode.
- Update the Maven repository URL in `pom.xml` with the new CodeArtifact URL:
  - Navigate to CodeArtifact → Maven Central Store → View Connection Instructions → Copy Maven URL.
  - Update `pom.xml` with the new URL.

**Settings.xml Changes**:
- Update `settings.xml` to include your Maven repository credentials:
  - Update username and token from Buildspec file.
  - Replace URLs in the profiles section and mirrors with the new repository URL.

**Buildspec.yaml Setup**:
- Ensure the Buildspec.yaml is renamed to `Buildspec.yml` and is located at the root directory of your project.
- Modify the Buildspec to include steps for obtaining the CodeArtifact token, installing necessary tools, and running the Sonar analysis:
  - Install necessary tools like Maven, Sonar CLI.
  - Run `mvn sonar` to upload results to SonarCloud.

#### 2. Creating AWS CodeBuild Project

**Step 1: Access AWS Console**  
- Search for **CodeBuild** in the AWS console and click on **Create Project**.

**Step 2: Configuring the Project**

- **Project Name**: Assign a meaningful name like `Wipro-Code-Analysis`.
- **Source Code**: Select Bitbucket as the source and connect using OAuth or Bitbucket App Password.
- **Environment**:
  - **Compute Resource**: Select On-Demand with standard environment, Ubuntu OS, and 7.0 runtime image.
  - **Service Role**: Create a new role with permissions for CodeBuild, Parameter Store, and CodeArtifact.

**Step 3: Attach Policies to Service Role**:
- Attach custom policies for:
  - **Parameter Store Read**: Allows access to describe parameters and read specific parameters.
  - **CodeArtifact Read-Only Access**: Provides read-only access to the CodeArtifact service.

**Step 4: Build Configuration**:
- Use the default Buildspec file located at the root directory.
- Ensure CloudWatch Logs are configured for monitoring and debugging.

**Step 5: Running the Build**:
- Start the build using **Start Build**. 
- Check the **Build Logs** for any issues if the build fails.

#### 3. Reviewing Build Results

- Once the build completes successfully, navigate to SonarCloud to view the analysis results.
  - In SonarCloud, check your projects to view code analysis results including bugs, code smells, and vulnerabilities.

### Conclusion:

This setup creates an AWS CodeBuild project that runs code analysis using SonarCloud and uploads the results. By using CodeBuild, you minimize costs and manage scalability efficiently while automating the build process for Sonar code analysis.
