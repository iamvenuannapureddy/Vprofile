## **Terraform Commands**

   1.terraform init
   
   2.terraform fmt
   
   3.terraform validate
   
   4.terraform plan
   
   5.terraform apply
   
   6.terraform destroy
   
   7.terraform Update


1. **Initialize Terraform**:
   - Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where your Terraform files are located (e.g., `exercise two`).
   - Run the command `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform working directory. This will download necessary provider libraries, like the AWS provider.
   
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Format the Configuration Files**:
   - Ensure that your configuration files are properly formatted by running the `terraform fmt` command. This corrects any formatting issues in files such as `instance.tf` and `provider.tf`.
   
   ```bash
   terraform fmt
   ```

3. **Validate the Configuration**:
   - Use `terraform validate` to check if the syntax of your Terraform files is correct. This will identify any errors or issues in the code.
   - If there are any errors (e.g., incorrect data types or wrong configurations), Terraform will display the relevant error messages.

   ```bash
   terraform validate
   ```

4. **Review and Run the Plan**:
   - Run `terraform plan` to see what Terraform intends to do based on the configuration files. This will compare your local files with the target infrastructure.
   - Terraform will show what resources will be created, modified, or destroyed. Always pay attention to resources that are **marked for destruction**, as accidental deletions can occur.
   
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

   - Example: It might show `7 to add`, meaning 7 resources will be created. Review all the details to ensure no unwanted changes are being made.

5. **Apply the Plan**:
   - If you're satisfied with the plan, proceed to apply the changes with the following command:
   
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   - Confirm the action by typing `yes` when prompted. This will execute the changes and reflect them in the target infrastructure.
   - Terraform will also create the `terraform.tfstate` file, which stores the current state of your infrastructure.

6. **Review the State File**:
   - Open the `terraform.tfstate` file to review the details of the created resources (e.g., instance IDs, regions). It will be in JSON format.

7. **Check the AWS Console**:
   - After applying the plan, verify the resources in your AWS console (e.g., EC2, Key Pairs, Security Groups). Check that all the resources, such as instances and key pairs, are created as expected.
   - Review security group rules and other configurations to ensure they match the Terraform configuration.

8. **Re-run the Plan After Changes**:
   - Make changes to the configuration files (e.g., changing security group rules, instance parameters, or tags). Save the files.
   - Run `terraform plan` again to check how Terraform plans to modify the infrastructure based on the changes.

9. **Apply the New Changes**:
   - If the plan looks good, run `terraform apply` again to apply the changes to the infrastructure. Always confirm by typing `yes`.

10. **Handling Immutable Changes**:
    - Some changes, such as changing the AMI or key pair for an EC2 instance, are immutable and will require the resource to be destroyed and recreated. Terraform will show a resource as "to destroy" and "to add" when these changes are made.

11. **Dealing with Missing Resources**:
    - If you reference a resource (e.g., a security group) that does not exist, Terraform will display an error during the plan phase, such as:
    
    ```bash
    Error: Security group resource does not exist
    ```

    - Fix any resource names or IDs that do not match the actual resources and re-run the plan.

12. **Changing Availability Zones**:
    - Changing the availability zone for a resource might require destroying and recreating it. Always review the plan carefully to understand the impact of such changes.
    - If the plan indicates that the resource will be destroyed and recreated, you can proceed with the apply action or revert the change if itâ€™s unintentional.

13. **Handle Manual Changes**:
    - If you manually change the state of the infrastructure (e.g., stopping an EC2 instance), Terraform will not automatically know the current state unless it's specified in the code.
    - To manage the state of a resource (e.g., instance state), you can use the appropriate resource configuration (e.g., `aws_ec2_instance_state` for EC2) and specify its desired state.

    Example configuration for EC2 instance state:
    
    ```hcl
    resource "aws_ec2_instance_state" "example" {
      instance_id = aws_instance.example.id
      state       = "running"
    }
    ```

14. **Terraform Destroy**:
    - To clean up and destroy all the resources managed by Terraform, use the `terraform destroy` command. This will remove all the resources defined in your configuration files.
    
    ```bash
    terraform destroy
    ```

    - Confirm with `yes` when prompted. This will delete all resources and ensure that the state file is reset.

15. **Important Tips**:
    - Always **double-check** the plan output to ensure no unwanted resources are being destroyed.
    - **Manual infrastructure changes** should be avoided. Always manage resources through Terraform to keep the state consistent.
    - If Terraform fails to apply the plan due to issues like invalid availability zones, ensure that the region and availability zone names are correct.

By following these steps, you can efficiently use Terraform to manage infrastructure and prevent errors or unintended changes. Always validate, plan, and review before applying any changes to production systems.
