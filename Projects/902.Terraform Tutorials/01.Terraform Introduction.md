# Terraform Introduction and Setup Guide

## Introduction to Terraform

### What is Terraform?
Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It is used to provision and manage infrastructure across various cloud providers.

### Terraform in Cloud Automation
Terraform automates cloud infrastructure management and supports multiple providers, including:
- AWS
- Azure
- Google Cloud
- Oracle Cloud
- Kubernetes
- Docker

Terraform helps make cloud environments "habitable" for applications, ensuring consistency and maintainability through declarative configurations.

## Installing Terraform

### Installation on macOS
```sh
brew tap hashicorp/tap
brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform
```

### Installation on Windows (Using Chocolatey)
```sh
choco install terraform
```

### Installation on Linux (Ubuntu/CentOS)
Visit the official Terraform documentation for the latest installation steps: [Terraform Install Guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

## Verifying Terraform Installation
Run the following command to verify the installation:
```sh
terraform --version
```
Expected output (version may vary):
```sh
Terraform v1.1.2
```

## Configuring AWS Credentials for Terraform
Terraform needs AWS access to manage infrastructure. This requires setting up an IAM user with the necessary permissions.

### Creating an IAM User in AWS
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the **IAM** service.
3. Click on **Users** → **Create User**.
4. Enter a user name, e.g., `TeraAdmin`.
5. Select **Attach policies directly** and assign `AdministratorAccess`.
6. Click **Next** → **Create User**.

### Generating AWS Access Keys
1. Select the created user (`TeraAdmin`).
2. Go to the **Security Credentials** tab.
3. Scroll down to **Access Keys** and click **Create Access Key**.
4. Choose **CLI (Command Line Interface)**, check the acknowledgment box, and click **Next** → **Create Access Key**.
5. Copy the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** securely.

### Configuring AWS CLI with Credentials
Open a terminal (Git Bash on Windows or any terminal on macOS/Linux) and run:
```sh
aws configure
```
Provide the following details when prompted:
```
AWS Access Key ID: <paste your Access Key ID>
AWS Secret Access Key: <paste your Secret Access Key>
Default region name: us-east-1
Default output format: json
```

## Writing Terraform Code

### Terraform Configuration Structure
Terraform uses a declarative configuration format, similar to JSON, written in **HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)**.

#### Example: Creating an EC2 Instance
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web01" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Example AMI ID
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  security_groups = ["default"]
}
```

### Formatting and Validating Terraform Code
Terraform provides built-in commands to check and format code:
```sh
terraform fmt      # Formats Terraform code
terraform validate # Validates Terraform configuration
```

## Understanding Terraform State Management
- Terraform maintains the state of infrastructure using a **state file (`terraform.tfstate`)**.
- When you apply changes, Terraform compares the current state with the desired state and updates accordingly.
- Example:
  - If an EC2 instance is shut down manually, running Terraform again will detect this and restart it.
  - If the instance name is changed in the configuration, Terraform will update the instance accordingly.

## Next Steps
- Install Terraform and configure AWS credentials.
- Write a simple Terraform script to create an EC2 instance.
- Learn more about Terraform commands (`plan`, `apply`, `destroy`).
- Explore Terraform modules and best practices.

This guide serves as a foundational step towards mastering Terraform for cloud automation.
