## 1. **Step 1: Powering on Instances and Updating Security Group Rules**
- **Notes:**
  - Ensure Continuous Integration project instances are powered on.
  - Update security group rules:
    - **Jenkins Security Group**:
      - SSH access: 22 from your IP.
      - HTTP access: 88 from anywhere.
    - **Nexus Security Group**:
      - SSH access: 22 from your IP.
      - HTTP access: 81 from your IP.
    - **Sonar Server Security Group**:
      - SSH access: 22 from your IP.
      - HTTP access: 80 from your IP.

### 2. **Step 2: Update Jenkins Webhook on GitHub**
- **Notes:**
  - Get Jenkins server public IP.
  - Navigate to the GitHub repository settings.
  - Edit Webhook, update the Jenkins IP carefully.
  - Test the Webhook for recent deliveries to ensure successful setup.

### 3. **Step 3: Preparing Code - Adding Docker Files and Jenkins Files**
- **Notes:**
  - Download the Docker file from the Vpro file project repository.
  - Extract the Docker files from the zip.
  - Copy Docker files into the repository used in Continuous Integration project.
  - Create `stage pipeline` and `prod pipeline` directories.
  - Copy the Jenkins file to both `stage pipeline` and `prod pipeline` directories.

### 4. **Step 4: Validating Configurations and Committing Changes**
- **Notes:**
  - Validate the `.git/config` file to ensure the correct branch is referenced (e.g., `ci-jenkins`).
  - Commit changes: `git add .`, `git commit -m "preparing ci-jenkins branch"`.
  - Push the branch to GitHub: `git push origin ci-jenkins`.

These notes outline the steps required to prepare and structure the Continuous Delivery pipeline.
