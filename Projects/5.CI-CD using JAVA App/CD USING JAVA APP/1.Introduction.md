## Continuous Delivery with Jenkins and Tools - Project Overview

#### Introduction

Continuous Delivery is an extension of Continuous Integration, which focuses on automating the entire process of code changes through testing, deployment, and delivery to pre-production environments. This ensures faster, reliable, and efficient software delivery while reducing manual intervention.

### **Project Scenario**

In an agile SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle), frequent code changes are made by developers. These changes are merged into remote repositories and need to go through a series of automated processes:

1. **Code Changes**: Developers commit and push code changes to GitHub.
2. **Build & Test**: Automated pipelines build the code, run unit tests, and conduct code analysis.
3. **Deployment**: Packages are deployed to staging environments for further testing.
4. **Approval**: Once the tests pass, artifacts are ready for production deployment after approval.

### **Challenges Addressed by Continuous Delivery**

- Frequent manual deployments are time-consuming and prone to errors.
- Increased dependencies between teams result in delays.
- Agile environments require a high pace of change, which cannot be handled manually.
- Automation reduces human intervention and increases the efficiency of the delivery process.

### **Tools and Flow**

1. **Tools**:
   - **Jenkins**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery server.
   - **GitHub**: Version control system for code changes.
   - **Maven**: Builds and tests Java artifacts.
   - **SonarQube**: Code analysis for quality gates.
   - **Slack**: Notifications for pipeline status.
   - **Docker**: Packaging Java artifacts into Docker images.
   - **Amazon ACR**: Registry to store Docker images.
   - **Amazon ECS**: Deploy Docker images to Elastic Container Service.

2. **Flow**:
   - Developer commits/pushes code to GitHub.
   - Jenkins fetches changes, builds, tests, and checks quality gates.
   - Docker images are created and stored in Amazon ACR.
   - Amazon ECS deploys Docker images to staging and production environments.

### **Objectives**

- **Fault Isolation**: Quickly isolate bugs and fix them.
- **Short MDR (Mean Time to Recovery)**: Minimize downtime and errors.
- **Fast Turnaround Time**: Enable quick delivery of new code.
- **Automation**: Reduce manual intervention to ensure smooth pipeline execution.

### **Steps for Continuous Delivery Pipeline Setup**

1. **Updating GitHub Webhook**: Ensure Jenkins IP is up-to-date for automatic execution of pipelines.
2. **Docker Image Preparation**: Build Docker images from Dockerfiles and store them in repositories like Amazon ACR.
3. **Jenkins Setup**: Install necessary plugins (e.g., Amazon ACR, Docker plugin) and configure Jenkins pipeline to build Docker images and deploy them to Amazon ECS.
4. **Deployment**: Set up Amazon ECS clusters, task definitions, and services for staging and production environments.
5. **Testing**: Conduct integration, load, and performance testing to ensure code stability.

This process ensures continuous delivery of code with minimal disruptions, faster turnaround times, and a highly automated workflow.
