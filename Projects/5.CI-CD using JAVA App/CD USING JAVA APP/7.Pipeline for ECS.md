# Notes - Deployment Pipeline Process

### Overview:

1. **Service Deployment**:
   - Created a service that initiated container tasks.
   - Container fetched the image from Amazon ACR and executed the task.

2. **Manual Deployment Steps**:
   - Manually setup included updating webhook in GitHub with new Jenkins IP.
   - Ran the Jenkins pipeline manually to deploy the container to ECS cluster.

3. **Jenkins Pipeline Setup**:
   - Installed required plugins and set up credentials (EWS credentials with access, secret key, and appropriate policy).
   - CLI command used to update the ECS cluster with the latest image.

4. **Automated Deployment**:
   - New image pushed to Amazon ACR triggers the Jenkins pipeline.
   - Pipeline steps include building, pushing the image, and deploying the container to ECS cluster.
   - Shell commands are executed with credentials to update ECS clusters.

5. **Deployment Steps**:
   - Shell command executed with EWS credentials to deploy the container to ECS.
   - Deployment forces the deletion of the old container and creation of a new container with the latest image.

6. **Testing & Verification**:
   - Post-deployment, verification is done through task logs and ECS UI.
   - Successful deployment leads to further testing and approval stages for production deployment.

**Deployment Pipeline Script (Jenkinsfile)**:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        cluster = "pro-staging"  // Replace with actual cluster name
        service = "your-service-name"  // Replace with actual service name
    }

    stages {
        stage('Build & Upload Image') {
            steps {
                echo "Building and uploading image..."
                // Add your build and upload steps here
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy to ECS Staging') {
            steps {
                withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'your-aws-credentials-id', passwordVariable: 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY', usernameVariable: 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')]) {
                    sh '''
                        aws ecs update-service --cluster ${cluster} --service ${service} --force-new-deployment
                    '''
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Important Notes**:
- Ensure credentials are securely stored and used appropriately in the pipeline.
- Regular testing and deployment verification should be done to ensure smooth operations.
- Separate pipelines for staging and production should be maintained for controlled deployments.
