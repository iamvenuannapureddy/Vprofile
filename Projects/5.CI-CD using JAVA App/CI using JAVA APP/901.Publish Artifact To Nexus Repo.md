## Uploading Artifacts to Nexus Repository

---

#### Steps for Uploading Artifacts to Nexus Repository

1. **Archiving Artifacts in Pipeline**:
   - In the Jenkins pipeline code, artifacts are archived using:
     ```groovy
     archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'target/*.jar'
     ```
   - Once archived, the artifacts can be accessed through the Jenkins workspace under `Target` directory.

2. **Configuring Build Timestamp Plugin**:
   - Navigate to **Manage Jenkins > Configure System**.
   - Scroll down to **Build Timestamp** and set a time zone.
   - Modify the pattern to `yy-MM-dd_HH-mm`.

3. **Uploading Artifacts to Nexus**:
   - Use the Nexus artifact uploader plugin in Jenkins Pipeline.

4. **Sample Jenkins Pipeline Code for Artifact Upload**:
   ```groovy
   stage('Upload Artifact') {
       steps {
           nexusArtifactUploader(
               nexusVersion: 'nexus3',
               protocol: 'http',
               nexusUrl: 'http://<Nexus_Private_IP>:8081',
               credentialsId: 'access_login',
               groupId: 'com.yourproject',
               version: "${BUILD_ID}-${BUILD_TIMESTAMP}",
               repository: 'profile-release',
               artifactId: 'proapp',
               artifactFile: 'target/vprofile-v2.var',
               packaging: 'var'
           )
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Testing the Artifact Upload**:
   - After configuring the pipeline stage for artifact upload, execute the pipeline.
   - Ensure that artifacts are successfully uploaded to Nexus repository.

#### Notes:
- **Build Timestamp** ensures a unique version for each build.
- **Nexus Artifact Uploader** uses specific variables for credentials and artifact details.
- Continuous integration builds, tests, and uploads artifacts to Nexus repository with unique versioning for each build using Jenkins.
