**Setting Up Key Pair and Security Groups for Jenkins, Nexus, and SonarQube in AWS**

### Key Pair Creation
1. **Region**: Ensure you are logged into the AWS Management Console in the North California region.
2. **Create Key Pair**:
   - Navigate to **Key Pairs** under the EC2 section.
   - Name the key pair: `we-profile-key`.
   - Select **PEM format** (for use with Git Bash or terminal). If using Putty, select **PCK format**.
   - Save the key file in a secure location (e.g., Downloads directory).

### Security Groups Setup
We will create three security groups: **Jenkins-SG**, **Nexus-SG**, and **Sonar-SG**. Each security group will have specific inbound rules.

#### **Jenkins Security Group**
1. **Name**: `Jenkins-SG`
2. **Inbound Rules**:
   - **Port 22** (SSH): Allowed from **My IP**.
   - **Port 8080** (Jenkins): Allowed from **anywhere** (IPv4 and IPv6) to enable GitHub webhooks.
3. **Outbound Rules**: No changes required (default).
4. Add a description and create the security group.

#### **Nexus Security Group**
1. **Name**: `Nexus-SG`
2. **Inbound Rules**:
   - **Port 22** (SSH): Allowed from **My IP**.
   - **Port 8081** (Nexus): Allowed from **My IP**.
   - **Port 8081**: Allowed from **Jenkins-SG**. This enables Jenkins to:
     - Upload artifacts to Nexus.
     - Download dependencies from Nexus.
3. **Outbound Rules**: No changes required (default).
4. Add a description and create the security group.

#### **SonarQube Security Group**
1. **Name**: `Sonar-SG`
2. **Inbound Rules**:
   - **Port 22** (SSH): Allowed from **My IP**.
   - **Port 9000** (SonarQube service): Allowed from **My IP**.
   - **Port 80** (additional service): Allowed from **My IP**.
   - **Port 80**: Allowed from **Jenkins-SG**. This enables Jenkins to upload test results to SonarQube.
3. **Outbound Rules**: No changes required (default).
4. Add a description and create the security group.

### Additional Configuration for Jenkins Security Group
1. Navigate to **Jenkins-SG**.
2. **Add Inbound Rule**:
   - **Port 8080**: Allowed from **Sonar-SG**. This is needed for SonarQube to send reports or results back to Jenkins.
   - Note: Port 8080 is already open to anywhere, but this rule is added for clarity in restricted environments.

### Best Practices and Tips
- **Security Considerations**:
  - Avoid opening ports to **anywhere** unless absolutely necessary.
  - If security is not a primary concern for the project, you can open all mentioned ports to **anywhere** for simplicity.
- **Dynamic IPs**:
  - If your public IP changes (common with broadband connections), update the security group rules for **Port 22** with your new IP.
  - Use a public IP lookup tool (e.g., Google “What is my IP?”) to find and add your updated IP.

### Recap
1. Create a key pair in PEM format.
2. Set up security groups with the appropriate rules for Jenkins, Nexus, and SonarQube.
3. Adjust rules dynamically if your public IP changes.
4. Review the security group configurations thoroughly to ensure proper connectivity.

Revisit these steps if needed to ensure understanding. Once ready, proceed to the next setup stage.
