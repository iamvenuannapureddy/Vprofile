# Project Notes: Deploying a Web Application on a Kubernetes Cluster

#### **Objective**
To deploy a **multi-tier web application (V-profile application)** on a Kubernetes cluster for production use with the following requirements:  
- **High Availability:** Ensure containers and compute nodes do not go down.  
- **Fault Tolerance:** Enable auto-healing for non-responsive containers.  
- **Scalability:** Scale both containers and compute resources easily.  
- **Portability:** Run containers across local, cloud, virtual, and physical environments, supporting dev, QA, and production environments.  
- Use **Kubernetes** as the container orchestration tool due to its maturity and robustness.

---

### **Project Overview**
1. **Web Application**:  
   - The **V-profile application**, which is already containerized and tested, will be used.  
   - It includes a **MySQL container** that requires persistent storage for its data.  

2. **Kubernetes Cluster**:  
   - Use **KOPS** to set up a **production-grade Kubernetes cluster**.  
   - The cluster will host the V-profile application for production.  

---

### **Steps to Deploy the Application**

#### **1. Prerequisites**
   - A **Kubernetes cluster** created using **KOPS**.  
   - Container images of the **V-profile application** (built and stored during the containerization project).  

---

#### **2. Setting Up Persistent Storage**
   - The **MySQL container** requires a persistent volume to store its data.  
   - **Create an AWS EBS Volume** for the database pod:  
     - Ensure the volume is created in a specific **AWS Availability Zone**.  
     - Example Command:  
       ```bash
       aws ec2 create-volume --size 10 --region us-east-1 --availability-zone us-east-1a --volume-type gp2
       ```

---

#### **3. Node Labeling**
   - Label Kubernetes nodes with **zone names** to ensure the DB pod runs in the same zone as the EBS volume.  
   - Example: Label a node:  
     ```bash
     kubectl label nodes <node-name> failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone=us-east-1a
     ```  

---

#### **4. Kubernetes Definition Files**
   - Write **Kubernetes YAML manifests** for deploying the V-profile application, including:  
     - **Deployment**: Define the desired state of the application pods.  
     - **Service**: Expose the application to enable communication between services and the outside world.  
     - **Secret**: Securely store sensitive information (e.g., database credentials).  
     - **PersistentVolume & PersistentVolumeClaim**: Bind the EBS volume to the MySQL container for persistent data storage.  
   - Example directory structure for YAML files:
     ```
     k8s-manifests/
     ├── deployment.yaml
     ├── service.yaml
     ├── secret.yaml
     ├── pv.yaml
     └── pvc.yaml
     ```

---

#### **5. Deploy the Application**
   - Apply the Kubernetes manifests to the cluster:  
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f k8s-manifests/
     ```  
   - Verify the resources are created:  
     ```bash
     kubectl get pods
     kubectl get services
     kubectl get pvc
     ```

---

#### **6. Testing**
   - Validate that the application is accessible via the service endpoint.  
   - Check logs of pods for debugging:  
     ```bash
     kubectl logs <pod-name>
     ```  

---

#### **7. Auto-scaling**
   - Configure **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** for scaling pods based on CPU/memory usage:  
     ```bash
     kubectl autoscale deployment <deployment-name> --cpu-percent=70 --min=1 --max=10
     ```  
   - Scale nodes dynamically using the cloud provider's auto-scaling feature (e.g., AWS Auto Scaling Groups).  

---

#### **8. Cleanup (Optional)**
   - Delete resources when no longer needed:  
     ```bash
     kubectl delete -f k8s-manifests/
     ```

---

### **Additional Notes**
- **Why Kubernetes?**  
  - Kubernetes dominates the container orchestration market (77% adoption, rising to 89% with managed distributions like Redshift and Rancher).  
  - From 2019–2020, there was a **28% growth** in Kubernetes usage for production containers.  
  - Organizations are increasingly adopting Kubernetes for its flexibility, fault tolerance, and scalability.  

- **Future Scope**:  
  - Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.  
  - Implement monitoring using **Prometheus** and **Grafana**.  
  - Leverage **Ingress Controllers** for advanced traffic routing.  

---

With these steps, you can deploy and manage your **V-profile web application** in a production-grade Kubernetes environment effectively.
