### Notes: Deploying Docker Containers on Amazon ECS

#### Introduction

In this guide, we are deploying a Docker container on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) using Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry) as the image repository. The steps include creating an ECS cluster, setting up services, and managing task definitions for container deployments.

---

### **Step 1: Create ECS Cluster**

1. **Log into AWS Console**:
   - Navigate to the AWS Management Console and select **North California Region** (or the region where Jenkins, Nexus, and SonarQube are set up).

2. **Create ECS Cluster**:
   - Search for "ECS" and select **Elastic Container Service**.
   - Click on **Get Started**.
   
3. **Cluster Configuration**:
   - Provide a cluster name (e.g., `staging`).
   - Choose appropriate subnets.
   - Use **serverless** option (`Forget`), which doesn’t require managing EC2 instances.

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Enable **Container Insights** for logging and monitoring.
   - Add a tag for easy identification (e.g., `pro-staging`).
   
5. **Create Cluster**:
   - Click **Create**. This will provision the ECS cluster.

6. **Cluster Created**:
   - Once the cluster is created, navigate to **ECS Dashboard**.

### **Step 2: Create ECS Task Definition**

1. **Create Task Definition**:
   - In the ECS dashboard, go to **Task Definitions** and click **Create New Task Definition**.
   
2. **Task Definition Configuration**:
   - Name the task definition (e.g., `pro-app-stage-task`).
   - Provide the **container name** (e.g., `pro-app`).
   - Use the Docker image from Amazon ECR:
     - Provide the URL of the ECR where the Docker image is stored.
   
3. **Container Configuration**:
   - Container Port: `8080`.
   - CPU: `1 CPU`.
   - Memory: `512 MB`.
   - Keep the rest of the settings as default and create the task definition.

---

### **Step 3: Create ECS Service**

1. **Create Service**:
   - In the ECS dashboard, click on **Cluster** and select the cluster (`staging`).
   - Click on **Deploy** to create a service.

2. **Service Configuration**:
   - Select **Deployment Configuration** as **Service** (creates a load balancer and auto scaling).
   - Choose **Launch Type** as `Forget`.
   - Select the task definition created earlier (`pro-app-stage-task`).

3. **Service Configuration**:
   - Provide a service name (e.g., `pro-app-stage-service`).
   - Number of tasks: `1` (initial deployment).
   - Networking:
     - Create a new security group (`pro-app-stage-sg`) with port `8080`.
     - Load Balancer:
       - Name: `pro-app-stage-lb`.
       - Listener Port: `80`.
       - Target Group: `pro-app-stage-dg` with health checks on `/login` (port `8080`).
   
4. **Deploy Service**:
   - Click **Deploy** to provision the service with a load balancer.

---

### **Step 4: Post Deployment Adjustments**

1. **Adjust Health Check**:
   - Navigate to **Target Groups** and edit health checks to use port `8080`.
   
2. **Update Security Group**:
   - Modify inbound rules in the security group to allow traffic on port `8080`.

---

### **Verification**

- After deployment, ensure the ECS service is running.
- Verify the load balancer’s health checks and status.
  
---

### **Next Steps**

- Automate the deployment of Docker containers using Jenkins and ECS.
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployment to production environments.
