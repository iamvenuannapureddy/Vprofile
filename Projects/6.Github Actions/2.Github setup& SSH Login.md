### Setting Up GitHub for CI/CD with GitHub Actions  

This guide covers setting up SSH login for GitHub, forking the repository, integrating with VS Code, and committing changes to verify the setup. Follow these steps carefully to ensure a smooth workflow.  

---

#### **1. Log in to GitHub**  
1. Open your browser and navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com).  
2. Log in to your GitHub account using your username and password.  

---

#### **2. Generate SSH Keys**  
1. Open **Git Bash** (Windows) or **Terminal** (macOS/Linux).  
2. Run the following commands to navigate to your SSH directory:  
   ```bash
   cd ~
   cd .ssh
   ```
3. Generate a new SSH key using:  
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen
   ```
   - Enter a descriptive name for the key (e.g., your GitHub username).  
   - Press **Enter** three times to use the default settings.  

4. Verify that the public and private key files are created.  

---

#### **3. Add SSH Key to GitHub**  
1. Display the contents of the public key file using:  
   ```bash
   cat <key_name>.pub
   ```
2. Copy the output.  
3. In your GitHub account:  
   - Go to **Settings** > **SSH and GPG Keys**.  
   - Click **New SSH Key**.  
   - Provide a title and paste the public key into the provided field.  
   - Click **Add SSH Key**.  

4. Authenticate using your GitHub password, if prompted.  

---

#### **4. Verify SSH Key Authentication**  
Run the following command to test the SSH connection:  
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<key_name> -T git@github.com
```  
- If asked, type **yes** to confirm.  
- You should see a success message indicating the authentication worked.  

---

#### **5. Fork the Repository**  
1. Navigate to the repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/coder/profile`).  
2. Click **Fork** to create a copy of the repository in your account.  
   - Ensure **“Copy the main branch only”** is unchecked.  
3. Verify the forked repository exists under your GitHub account.  

---

#### **6. Clone the Forked Repository**  
1. In Git Bash/Terminal, create a folder to clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/Desktop/actions
   cd ~/Desktop/actions
   ```
2. Copy the SSH URL of your forked repository from GitHub.  
3. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:<your_username>/profile.git
   ```  
4. Navigate into the cloned repository:  
   ```bash
   cd profile
   ```  

---

#### **7. Configure SSH Key for Repository**  
1. Temporarily set the SSH key environment variable:  
   ```bash
   export GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -i ~/.ssh/<key_name>"
   ```  
2. Unset the variable after cloning:  
   ```bash
   unset GIT_SSH_COMMAND
   ```  
3. Add SSH key configuration specific to this repository:  
   ```bash
   git config core.sshCommand "ssh -i ~/.ssh/<key_name> -F /dev/null"
   ```  

---

#### **8. Set User Details for Commits**  
1. Configure your username:  
   ```bash
   git config user.name "<your_username>"
   ```  
2. Configure your email:  
   ```bash
   git config user.email "<your_email>"
   ```  

---

#### **9. Open Repository in VS Code**  
1. Open **Visual Studio Code**.  
2. Select **File** > **Open Folder**.  
3. Navigate to the cloned repository folder (e.g., `~/Desktop/actions/profile`) and click **Select Folder**.  

---

#### **10. Make a Test Commit**  
1. Open the `README.md` file in VS Code.  
2. Modify the file (e.g., add/remove a hash).  
3. Save the changes using `Ctrl + S`.  
4. Go to the **Source Control** tab in VS Code.  
5. Stage the changes and add a commit message (e.g., `Test integration`).  
6. Click **Commit and Push** to push the changes to GitHub.  

---

#### **11. Verify Changes on GitHub**  
1. Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub.  
2. Check the `README.md` file for the new commit and verify the changes.
