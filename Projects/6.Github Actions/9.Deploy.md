## Deploying a New Image Tag to ECS Service

#### Step 1: Obtain the Task Definition File

1. Navigate to **ECS > Task Definitions** in the AWS Console.
2. Select your task definition and click **Revision**.
3. Click on **JSON** to view the task definition in JSON format.
4. Copy the JSON content and save it in your local environment (e.g., in `VS Code`).

#### Step 2: Prepare Workflow File for Deployment

1. Create a new job in your CI/CD workflow to deploy a new task definition to ECS.
2. Ensure that the task definition is updated with the new image tag, fetched from AWS ECR.
3. Use the following variables:
   - `ECR_repository`: Name of the repository (e.g., `act-app`).
   - `service_name`: Name of the ECS service.
   - `cluster_name`: Name of the ECS cluster.
   - `task_definition_file_path`: Path to the task definition JSON file.
   - `container_name`: Name of the container (e.g., `wipro-app`).

4. Example variables:
   ```yaml
   env:
     - name: ECR_repository
       value: "act-app"
     - name: service_name
       value: "x-service"
     - name: cluster_name
       value: "x-cluster"
     - name: task_definition_file_path
       value: "path/to/task_definition.json"
     - name: container_name
       value: "wipro-app"
   ```

#### Step 3: Define Steps in Workflow

1. **Clone Source Code**: Checkout the source code from the repository.
   
2. **Log in to AWS**:
   - Use AWS credentials (access key and secret key) and region to authenticate.

3. **Update Task Definition**:
   - Use `ECR_repository` and `task_definition_file_path` to update the task definition.
   - Construct the image name with tag using:
     ```yaml
     image: "${{ secrets.ECR_URI }}/${{ ECR_repository }}:${{ github.run_number }}"
     ```
   
4. **Deploy Task Definition**:
   - Use `steps` from the previous job to pull the updated task definition.
   - Deploy the new task definition to ECS cluster using:
     ```yaml
     service: ${{ service_name }}
     cluster: ${{ cluster_name }}
     taskDefinition: ${{ steps.task-dev.outputs.task_definition }}
     waitForServiceStability: true
     ```

#### Step 4: Commit and Push Changes

1. Commit and push the workflow file to initiate deployment when a new push event occurs.

#### Step 5: Verify Deployment

1. Monitor the deployment progress through AWS ECS dashboard.
2. Ensure the deployment is completed successfully and the task definition reflects the updated image tag.

#### Step 6: Cleanup

1. Delete ECS services and clusters as required to avoid unnecessary costs.
2. Optionally, delete the AWS IAM user created for this workflow for security purposes.

This step-by-step approach ensures a clear understanding and execution of deploying new image tags using CI/CD pipelines in AWS ECS.
