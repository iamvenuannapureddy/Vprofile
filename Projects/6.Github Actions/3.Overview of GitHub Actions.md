### Step-by-Step Guide: Creating a Workflow in GitHub Actions

1. **Preparation**:
   - Ensure your source code is available in a GitHub repository.
   - Verify that you can commit changes to your source code repository.

2. **Introduction to GitHub Actions**:
   - GitHub Actions is used for automating workflows such as building, testing, and deploying your code.
   - Similar to pipelines in tools like Jenkins, a GitHub workflow consists of jobs, which represent different stages or tasks in your CI/CD pipeline.

3. **Creating a Basic Workflow**:
   - Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
   - Click on the "Actions" tab located in the repository.

4. **Creating a New Workflow**:
   - Click on "Get started with GitHub Actions."
   - Choose the "set up a workflow yourself" option to create a workflow from scratch.

5. **Setting Up the Workflow**:
   - A `.github/workflows/` folder is created in the repository.
   - Create a new YAML file within the `workflows` folder. Name it, for example, `main.yml`. Ensure the file has a `.yml` extension.

6. **Defining the Workflow**:
   - The YAML file begins with defining the workflow's name:
     ```yaml
     name: Age Profile Actions
     ```
   
7. **Triggering the Workflow**:
   - Specify how the workflow is triggered. In this case, we keep it manual with:
     ```yaml
     on:
       workflow_dispatch:
     ```
   - Later, we will modify this to trigger on push events.

8. **Defining Jobs**:
   - Each workflow consists of jobs. Define a job with a job name, such as:
     ```yaml
     jobs:
       testing:
     ```
   - Add steps for the job. Use the `steps` section to define individual tasks within the job:
     ```yaml
     steps:
       - name: Testing Workflow
         run: echo "Workflow works"
     ```

9. **Executing the Workflow**:
   - Commit the YAML file to your GitHub repository.
   - Navigate to the "Actions" tab and click on the newly created workflow.
   - Click "Run Workflow" and choose the workflow.

10. **Reviewing the Workflow**:
    - Once the workflow runs, review the results. A job (e.g., `testing`) should execute its steps.
    - Expand the job to view the steps and their results.

11. **Final Steps**:
    - For a more complex workflow, additional steps can be added for tasks like running Maven, Checkstyle, Sonar Scanner, and uploading results to Sonar Cloud for quality checks.
    - Ensure the workflow is refined based on requirements and best practices.
