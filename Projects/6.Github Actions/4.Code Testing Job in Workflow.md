### Step-by-Step Guide: Enhancing GitHub Actions Workflow with Maven and SonarCloud Integration

---

#### **1. Objective**  
To extend the GitHub Actions workflow to:  
- Clone the source code repository.  
- Execute Maven commands for testing and Checkstyle analysis.  
- Prepare the workflow for integrating Sonar Scanner and uploading results to SonarCloud.

---

#### **2. Key Considerations**  
- **Default Behavior**: GitHub Actions does **not clone the source code** automatically onto the runner.  
  - The first step must always be to **clone the repository**.  
- **GitHub Marketplace Tools**: Actions from the GitHub Marketplace can streamline tasks such as source code checkout and Sonar Scanner integration.

### Workflow Implementation

#### **Step 1: Add Source Code Checkout**  
1. Replace the previous step (`run`) with the **checkout action** from GitHub Marketplace.
2. Use the latest version of the `actions/checkout` tool:
   ```yaml
   - name: Checkout Code
     uses: actions/checkout@v4
   ```
3. The `actions/checkout` action will clone the source code from the GitHub repository to the runner.

---

#### **Step 2: Run Maven Test Command**  
1. Add a new step to execute Maven tests:
   ```yaml
   - name: Run Maven Tests
     run: mvn test
   ```
2. Maven is pre-installed in the `ubuntu-latest` runner provided by GitHub, so no additional setup is required.

---

#### **Step 3: Run Checkstyle Analysis**  
1. Add a step to perform Checkstyle analysis:
   ```yaml
   - name: Run Checkstyle Analysis
     run: mvn checkstyle:checkstyle
   ```
2. This command uses the `checkstyle` plugin to analyze the source code and generate a report.

---

#### **Step 4: Validate Workflow**  
1. Save the updated workflow YAML file in your repository:
   - File path: `.github/workflows/main.yml`
   - Commit message: `Maven code analysis in workflow`
2. Push the changes to the GitHub repository:
   - Run the following commands in your terminal or use your IDE:
     ```bash
     git add .github/workflows/main.yml
     git commit -m "Maven code analysis in workflow"
     git push origin main
     ```

---

#### **Step 5: Test Workflow Execution**  
1. Navigate to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.  
2. Locate the workflow you modified (e.g., `Age Profile Actions`).  
3. Click on **Run Workflow** to manually trigger the pipeline.  
4. Refresh the page if the workflow is not immediately visible.  
5. Monitor the execution:
   - Click on the running workflow.
   - Expand the `testing` job to see the logs for each step:
     - `Checkout Code`
     - `Run Maven Tests`
     - `Run Checkstyle Analysis`

---

#### **Step 6: Prepare for Sonar Scanner Integration**  
- The next step will involve:
  1. Adding a step to scan the source code using Sonar Scanner.
  2. Uploading the results to SonarCloud.
  3. Checking quality gates to validate code quality.

This concludes the setup for Maven testing and Checkstyle analysis in your GitHub Actions workflow. Proceed to the next lecture to integrate Sonar Scanner and SonarCloud.
