### **Setting up Job to Build and Push Docker Image to AWS ECR**

---

#### **Overview**
This lecture explains the process of building a Docker image from a multi-stage Dockerfile and pushing it to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). The process involves modifying the application properties file dynamically using GitHub secrets and automating the entire process using a GitHub Actions workflow.

---

### **Step-by-Step Process**

---

#### **1. Review the Dockerfile**
- The **Dockerfile** is a multi-stage file to build the application image:
  1. **Base Image**: Uses `openjdk` to install Maven, copy source code, and build the artifact.
  2. **Build Stage**:
     - Copies the source code into `/profile-project`.
     - Runs `mvn install` to generate the artifact (`profile-v2.war`).
  3. **Final Stage**:
     - Uses a `tomcat` image.
     - Removes the default application from Tomcat.
     - Copies the artifact (`profile-v2.war`) to `/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war`.
     - Exposes port **8080** and specifies `catalina run` as the entrypoint.

---

#### **2. Modify the `application.properties` File**
- The `application.properties` file (located in `src/main/resources`) contains database credentials and connection details.
- Replace placeholder values (`db01`, `admin`, `admin123`) with actual values stored in GitHub Secrets using the `sed` command during the workflow.

---

#### **3. Update the GitHub Actions Workflow**
- Add a **new job** called `build_and_publish` to:
  1. Build the Docker image.
  2. Push the image to AWS ECR.

**Steps to Update:**
1. **Create a New Job**:
   - Add a new job called `build_and_publish` in the GitHub Actions workflow.
   - Define it to run on `ubuntu-latest`.

2. **Steps for `build_and_publish` Job**:
   1. **Check Out Code**:
      - Reuse the `actions/checkout` step from the `testing` job to fetch the repository's source code.

   2. **Update `application.properties`**:
      - Use the `sed` command to replace placeholders in the `application.properties` file with values from GitHub Secrets:
        ```bash
        sed -i 's/^jdbc.username=.*$/jdbc.username=${{ secrets.DB_USER }}/' src/main/resources/application.properties
        sed -i 's/^jdbc.password=.*$/jdbc.password=${{ secrets.DB_PASS }}/' src/main/resources/application.properties
        sed -i 's/^jdbc.url=.*$/jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://${{ secrets.DB_ENDPOINT }}/' src/main/resources/application.properties
        ```

   3. **Build and Push Docker Image**:
      - Use the `docker-build-push` action from the GitHub Marketplace:
        - **Inputs**:
          - AWS access keys and ECR registry information (from GitHub Secrets).
          - **Region**: Define in an `env` variable (`us-east-2` for this example).
          - **Tags**: Add `latest` and the GitHub Actions build number (`github.run_number`).

      ```yaml
      - name: Build and Push Docker Image
        uses: appleboy/docker-action@v1
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          password: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          registry: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGISTRY }}
          repository: app
          region: ${{ env.REGION }}
          tags: latest,${{ github.run_number }}
          dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
          context: ./
      ```

3. **Set Job Dependency**:
   - Add `needs: testing` to the `build_and_publish` job to ensure it runs only after the `testing` job is completed successfully.

4. **Define Region as Environment Variable**:
   - Add the `REGION` environment variable at the top of the workflow:
     ```yaml
     env:
       REGION: us-east-2
     ```

---

#### **4. Push Workflow Changes**
- Save and commit the changes to the workflow file with a message:
  ```
  Commit message: Add build and push job to workflow
  ```
- Push the changes to the GitHub repository.

---

#### **5. Validate Workflow Execution**
1. Go to the GitHub repository **Actions** tab.
2. Run the workflow and monitor the execution:
   - Ensure the `testing` job completes successfully before the `build_and_publish` job starts.
3. Verify the Docker image upload:
   - Go to the AWS ECR console.
   - Refresh the repository to see the image with the `latest` and `run_number` tags.

---

### **Key Points**
- **Multi-stage Dockerfile**: Ensures efficient build and deployment by separating build and runtime stages.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Utilizes `sed` commands to replace placeholders in configuration files with secret values.
- **AWS ECR**: Stores Docker images securely.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates the CI/CD process with job dependencies and reusable secrets.

In the next lecture, we will deploy the newly built Docker image to an ECS cluster. Ensure this workflow executes successfully before proceeding.
