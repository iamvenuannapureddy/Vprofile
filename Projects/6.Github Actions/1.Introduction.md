**GitHub Actions**
### **Introduction to CI/CD using GitHub Actions**
- **GitHub Actions** is a popular CI/CD framework that seamlessly integrates with GitHub repositories, providing a convenient way to create workflows for automation.
- This project introduces the CI/CD aspect of **GitOps** using GitHub Actions while manually setting up the infrastructure on AWS.  
- Future enhancements will include automating the infrastructure setup with tools like **Terraform**, enabling a complete GitOps workflow.

### **Tools and Services Used in This Project**
1. **GitHub Repository**: Stores the project source code.
2. **GitHub Actions**: Automates CI/CD workflows.
3. **Maven**: Builds the code.
4. **SonarQube/SonarCloud**: Performs code quality analysis and enforces quality gates.
5. **Docker**: Packages the application into a container image.
6. **AWS ECR**: Stores the Docker images.
7. **AWS ECS**: Runs the containers.
8. **Load Balancer**: Exposes the application to the outside world.
9. **Amazon RDS**: Provides an SQL database for the application.

---

### **CI/CD Workflow Steps**
#### **1. GitHub Repository Setup**
- Fork the provided GitHub repository into your account.
- Set up SSH access to your GitHub repository.
- Integrate the repository with **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** for code editing, committing, and pushing.

---

#### **2. GitHub Actions Workflow**
The CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions consists of multiple jobs, each containing specific steps:

##### **Job 1: Code Testing and Analysis**
1. **Fetch Source Code**  
   - Fetch the source code from the GitHub repository.

2. **Run Code Tests**  
   - Use **Maven** to run unit tests and generate reports.

3. **Check Code Quality**  
   - Use **Checkstyle** for coding standards compliance.
   - Use **SonarQube/SonarCloud** to scan the code and verify quality gates.

4. **Upload Results to SonarCloud**  
   - Integrate GitHub Actions with **SonarCloud** to upload test results and quality gate statuses.

---

##### **Job 2: Build and Push Docker Image**
1. **Fetch Source Code**  
   - Fetch the latest source code from the repository.

2. **Build Docker Image**  
   - Create a Docker image from the source code using the `Dockerfile`.

3. **Push Docker Image to AWS ECR**  
   - Push the Docker image to **AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**.  
   - Note: You can replace ECR with **Google Container Registry** or **Docker Hub** as per your requirements.

---

##### **Job 3: Deploy Application**
1. **Set Up ECS Cluster and Task Definition**  
   - Create an **ECS cluster** and configure a **task definition**.  
   - Define the Docker image name and tag in the task definition.

2. **Deploy Docker Image to ECS**  
   - Instruct the ECS cluster to pull the Docker image from ECR and deploy it as a container.

3. **Integrate with Amazon RDS**  
   - Provide database access to the container by connecting it with an **Amazon RDS** instance.

4. **Expose Application via Load Balancer**  
   - Configure a **Load Balancer** in ECS to expose the application to users.

---

### **Architecture Overview**
1. **GitHub Actions**:
   - Contains the CI/CD workflow with jobs for testing, building, and deploying.
   - Fetches source code from the GitHub repository.

2. **AWS ECR**:
   - Stores Docker images built in the CI pipeline.

3. **AWS ECS**:
   - Deploys containers from the Docker images stored in ECR.

4. **Load Balancer**:
   - Routes traffic to the running application containers.

5. **Amazon RDS**:
   - Serves as the SQL database for the application.

---

### **Key Points for Explanation**
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Explain how workflows consist of jobs and steps.
- **Code Testing and Analysis**: Highlight the use of Maven, Checkstyle, and SonarCloud for ensuring code quality.
- **Docker Integration**: Describe building and pushing Docker images to ECR.
- **Application Deployment**: Explain ECS cluster setup, task definition, and integration with RDS and Load Balancer.
- **End-to-End Flow**: Walk through the process from fetching source code to exposing the application via Load Balancer.

---

### **Conclusion**
This project serves as an introduction to GitOps using GitHub Actions. By combining manual AWS setup and automated CI/CD pipelines, it lays the groundwork for a scalable and automated DevOps workflow. In future projects, the infrastructure setup can be fully automated with **Terraform** for a complete GitOps implementation.
